nap californ cnn shawnee's voic is shrill quav on the edg of desperate
sh clutch her 11-month-old son whil try to comprehend the situ unfold in front of her
h boyfriend her child's fath aaron is in handcuffs
why ar you doing this
she plead with pol off stand on the lawn outsid her home
your baby doesnt nee to be subject to marijuan an off reply in an audio record mad by shawn on her cel phone
but she could explain the coupl hav leg prescrib for the marijuan in their home
his is prescrib for anxy and chronic pain her for depress and anxiety
i told them we had our card our prescrib said shawn 27
they didnt want to see them
not long aft that exchang accord to pol video of the family's encount a soc work ar at the hom and decid to plac the child in fost care
cnn is not us shawn and aaron's last nam or the nam of their child becaus of the ongo child protect case
i was plead with them look you guy i understand yo perceiv but we ar wond par hardwork memb of our commun said aaron 34
they could not conceiv of the fact that you can be a wond par a dec hum being and med with marijuana
dr sanjay gupt doubl down on med marijuan for ag enl to protect childr marijuan in the hom has for decad been an invit for sery spec about a parent's fitness
but as the nar of med marijuan leg unfold across the country so doe a comply parallel story of paty whos childr ar being remov to protect custody or wors perm remov ostens becaus of their leg marijuan use
most med marijuan legisl doe not seem to account for thi possibility
the judg the pol cps child protect serv hav been fight thi war on drug for so long said mar green a med marijuan paty in lans michig whos inf daught bre was plac in fost car last year
they just cant get it out of their mind that thi is an evil drug they hav to fight against
to be sur each cas has un circumst and child welf off at both the stat and loc level do not com about spec cas whil they ar in process or ev ont they ar closed
further comply the pict whil med marijuan us is leg in 20 stat and the district of columb the fed drug enforc admin class the drug as a schedule i subst with no cur acceiv med us in the unit stat and high pot for abuse
in cas involv remov of childr med marijuan found in the hom would seem to be bar distinct from oth schedule i subst such as heroin or ecstasy
cps handl cas the sam way regardless of what the drug  is said michael weston deputy direct of publ affair and outreach program at the californ depart of soc services
everything is weigh in ref to is thi a dang to the child
is ther a pot harm to the child
is thi show sign of abus or neglect
minister's daught cannab is a gift from god ther hav been no subst study yet to determin how med marijuan impact parenting
there is ear dat accord to a research suggest a smal increas in child poison among med marijuan paty in stat wher it is legal
and ear epidemiolog dat draw a link between med cannab us and increas corp pun and phys abus but not neglect
we real dont know what's going on said bridget freisthl an assocy profess in the depart of soc welf at ucl who study med marijuan us among parents
we dont know wheth med marijuan affect par or wheth casework nee to be concern when they find out thi is hap in the home
parents fight to maintain custody of their childr say the mer pres of med marijuan is an almost reflex trig for removal
they cit scor of anecdot cont in stat wher med cannab is leg childr remov from hom wher cannab is us or grown baby test posit for marijuan at bir and subsequ remov childr remov becaus moth breastf at the sam tim that they us med marijuana
marijuan us doe not mak someon a bad par said sar arnold co-founder of the famy law and cannab alliance
it should not be the prim or sol bas for any child protect serv investigation
but simply hav a med marijuan card doe not mean that that paty is act respons with the med nor doe the mer pres of marijuan imply lack of saf accord to experts
medical marijuan as a risk fact by itself doesnt mean the child isnt saf said michael piraino chief execut off of nat cas for childr an advoc group for abus and neglect children
most kid hav had risk fact but remain safe
but how do you put togeth al thes piec of inform of evid that a child is or isnt safe
medical marijuan refug thi was our on hop the answ can be as vary as the hom wher med marijuan is used
piraino say issu rel to med marijuan us and par hav start to com up for his ag but not yet in a sign way
he not that any drug in the hom carry risk includ pot lack of at to children's nee and phys dang stem from poss ingest but that the ext of thos risk with med marijuan is not clear
aaron and shawn bristl at the ongo deb about their par and wors the not that their us of cannab could rais concern about abus or neglect of their child
they say their son is healthy happy and nurtured
what brought pol off to their hom in ear janu they say was an anoma a loud argument
the clam was heard by a neighb who cal the police
when off lat ent their hom to investig they discov loos marijuan cannab oil and marijuan cigaret strewn on the desk in the couple's liv room
the liv room smel lik marijuana
aaron say the smel was ling from the coupl med the night bef aft their son fel asleep
 what i want you to understand is yo baby doesnt nee to be subject to marijuan said on off in the pol video
shawnee respond what mak you think he is
because yo hous real smel bad of marijuan said the officer
the smel of marijuan a hom in a disarray med cannab that was vis albeit out of the boy's reach ar the root of the ongo cas against them
we would nev allow our childr to get into our med marijuan said aaron ad that he believ stigm against the plant is at the heart of his and oth cases
if law enforc and cps had com in ev if it was a coupl of empty beer bottl or a win bottl i dont think anybody would hav rais an eyebrow
i had the impress that we had turn thi corn he added
that we had mov past that stigma
is the child happy
is the child loved
is the child wel car for
said arnold who stressed that she has no spec inform about shawn and aaron's cas but view it through the len of countless oth famy she's counseled
marijuana on a desk doe not mean they're abus or neglect the child
nor doe grow and us marijuan said green the michig moth whos 6-month-old daught was remov from her custody for two month last september
according to michig law both green and her husband stev ar allow to us cannab med she to tre multipl sclerosis her husband to tre epilepsy
and she is allow to grow a certain numb of plant to supply to oth patients
green say the plant wer grown behind a lock door the childr nev had access to them and the coupl nev med in front of the children
they kept the marijuan they us lock up
she say a custody battl with her ex-husband involv a son from a prevy marry led cps to her door and she say despit the pain they had tak to shield their childr from the marijuan bre was remov from the hom and assign to protect custody
a maj issu deb dur the cas wheth marijuan plant grown in the green hom increas the dang of arm robbery and thu pos a sery saf issu for childr in the hom in oth word wheth theoret risk of harm to a child constitut a sery saf concern
green and oth advoc say that theoret pot risk is not enough
i find it very scary that par can hav childr tak away for someth that's a pot said arnold
video dr sanjay gupt expl polit of pot as a consequ of bree's remov mar and stev green wer ord to stop us med cannabis
she say she suff som pain and had to us a walk at interv but stev was wors off
he suff nin or 10 seiz dur the two month bre spent in fost care
you'v got thes par hav to choos between their medicin and their famy said arnold
that's an imposs cho espec if yo medicin mak you funct enough to parent
green say that med marijuan paty may not real the risk of a run-in with cps
she adv paty not to becom too lax and to real that not everyon includ law enforc cps and the jud system view the marijuan plant through the sam lens
think about what ar you doing with the med wher ar you smok who is watch yo kid when you're smok or und the influence
said green
have thos thing in place
my adv to par is to real go out of yo way to mak sur yo childr ar not expos to it
after spend a few day in jail and their son spend 12 day in fost car aaron and shawn say they now understand
they ar set asid their view about marijuan as a med tre and view it at least temp as a pot barry to maintain their famy unit
th doe not eas their confus about the law or their convict that the plant has medicin value
ther ar famy out ther  destroy ov a medicin plant said aaron
it's baffling
