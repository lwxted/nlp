how 'ban bossy' promot equality
editor's not ann mar chvez is the ceo of girl scout of the usa
cnn assert and bold strong and courageous
these ar the word we us when we think of our lead the charact we look for when we elect polit vet ceo or select captain of sport teams
yet throughout hist thes term hav been prim apply when men hav occupy lead roles
we expect men to lead and assert themselv and we enco and reward thes behavy when young boy exhibit them
so why is it when a young girl exhibit thes exact sam charact we oft resort to a diff word to describ her behavior
a word that say to young girl thes ar not the behavy we expect from you
why do we cal her bossy
it seem lik a littl thing it's just a word aft all
plus shouldnt we be teach our childr that word mat less than act or deeds
but word hav pow and mean espec dur the crit ear grade-school year when boy and girl alik ar develop their sens of self and find their plac in the world
according to the girl scout research institut ban bossy nat you pol 2014 mor than a third of girl who ar cal bossy los interest in lead and stop mak decid or suggestions
children begin to est gend rol stereotyp as ear as 2 year old and gen an emerg car id by middl school
as ear as the third grad girl report anxy about tak lead rol becom ov concern about pleas oth and aspir to be perfect
by the tim they reach middl school the dam is done
a 2003 study by simmon colleg not that by the ear teen year mor boy than girl report that they aspir to lead rol in fut car and millen wom ar less lik to say they aspir to a lead rol in whatev field i ultim work
whether int or not the mess is clear socy is both act and pass disco girl from exhibit lead qual and that is transl to a gen of girl afraid to tak the rein of lead for fear of being disliked
and that is a loss for al of us
we can no long afford to hav half the pop sidelin their skil and their insight ign becaus of the mess they receiv as girls
that is why at girl scout we hav team up with facebook's sheryl sandberg and form us secret of stat condoleezz ric to launch our ban bossy campaign a cal for socy to stop cal girl who exhibit lead bossy and instead enco and reward thos behavy the sam way we would for boys
opinion sheryl sandberg wrong on bossy ban as the premy lead org for girl in the country the girl scout hav been doing thi for 102 years
we've found that women's lead journey begin as girl and their fut depend on receiv the sam kind of enco and support boy receiv when they demonst lead capac in life
i know how limit word can be
as a young latin grow up in small-town arizon i watch as my moth tri to break the conv of her tim and plac run for the loc school board when it was unheard of for a fem let alon a hisp fem to do so
i watch and list as peopl includ famy and friend tri to disco her from running
but i was fortun becaus i also saw my fath support my mom and her ambitions
when he was told he had to mak sur his wif knew her plac he respond that her plac was to lead
words can hurt or heal they can shap our perceiv and eith enco our ambit or limit our understand of what we can become
when we ref to a girl who demonst lead qual as bossy she receiv a mess she is doing someth wrong that somehow the sam behavy we pra and reward in boy ar inappropry for her and we ar limit the scop of her pot as a result
so the next tim you hav the urg to cal a littl girl bossy stop tak a brea and say she's a leader
it's tim to redirect the pow of word to girl themselv so that girl and lead mean on and the same
it's tim to ban bossy
