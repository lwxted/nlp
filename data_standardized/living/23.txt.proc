most of the tim she exploit that she built on thos jok and got everyon to laugh at me she says
she mad me feel lik i knew noth that i was a child and i was immature
what you dont get about nfl bul what mad the dynam ev mor confus and comply to stop is that ther wer of cours jol tim espec when nobody els was around to impress
but the dat book was the fin chapt in their story love-hat relationship
you cant keep victim yourself lik that she says
communication expert lil glass decid to pen the book tox peopl 10 way of deal with peopl who mak yo lif mis aft hear many tal lik zakaria's
the definit of friend is admir and respect and if you dont hav thos two you hav noth glass told cnn
when friend becom bul ther ar two typ of tox friend say glass thos that start out tox and thos that start to requir a hazm suit ov time
when a friend start out ov contenty or competit it's wor ask why you're pursu it in the first place
you might be recr an unhealthy pattern perhap model yo rel with a par who belittl you as a stand-in for show affection
sometimes what we dont resolv we rep glass says
on the oth hand pal can simply evolv in opposit direct thi is particul tru in friend that hav end sint adolescence
chang though isnt inh a bad thing
it's mor when ther is a discrep in person and valu or a friend disco success say psycholog ir s levine
levin also wrot a book on prick pact titl best friend forev surv a breakup with yo best friend
since friend ar volunt rel it mak no sens that they bring you down she says
she stresses in the book that peopl mak many friend in lif but on a few stick for prolong periods
those long-stand bond levin say ar particul hard to navig or end becaus of the sign loss in cut ties
these peopl ar lik scrapbooks of our liv collect of our memories
it' very nic to be abl to reminisc and hav someon know yo root and know you in a diff phas she says
an uncord split could put mut friend in an awkward situation
if the tox friend's nat is spit or veng there's also the pot that he or she could unleash a firestorm of secret and confid you shar through the years
but glass say if that's their nat they're prob already talk behind yo back
deny it or ign it and dist yourself she says
then again as they say dont tel yo best friend what you wouldnt want yo worst enemy to know
short of dump the friend levin suggest ther ar oth way to attempt to eas the tend tak a break from the person by speak and see them less frequently
if the oth party is persist or guilt-trips you for not being around a littl whit lie about scheduling could be in order
levine say it's nic to want to maintain a longtim connect but if non of thes fix work the offend party must find a way to end it
although it might be hard to address awkward try to be direct but ultim kind
and nev end a friend impulsively
you real nee to think very car bef you do it levin says
there' no going back
people wil nev forget that conversation
