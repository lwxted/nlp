that's an 80-minute period every monday dur which emy and her classm work on project entir of their choosing
over month of study emy and her friend hav spent their tim research run sho what peopl pref and why
it's definit the highlight of my week say emy 12
it's not a project a teach assign it's someth that act interest you and it get you learn in diff way from what we do the rest of the day at school
her classroom's geni hour was inspir by google's 20 tim in which allow employ to ded 20 of work hour to their own ideas
the conceiv is now catch on in schools us root in the ide of student-led pass project with a foc on cre and sharing
teachers said it's part of a larg mov in educ to promot student-driven learn ens that young peopl learn to think for themselves
educator across grad level ar ask stud to com up with their own quest do their own research and form their own conclusions

provenzano was also inspir by convers on twit and launch 20 tim thi fal aft a sum of plan and set guidelin for stud to follow
a key on on his list of command fail is an option
amid press to pass test and success let stud know that fail is acceiv allow them to tak risk he said
with geni hour fail is an acceiv result and the emphas is in learn from failure
this allow stud to push themselv and tak risks
traditional learn environ do not support that approach he said
i ask my stud what they lik about thi project and the most common respons was that they lov the freedom to expl what they ar pass about instead of just doing the work they hav been assign by teachers
that freedom is what mot them to expl big idea and tak own of their learning
in an er when standard test domin educ convers it can be tough for teach to sel admin par and ev stud on the idea
but there's a lot for stud to learn when they hav som freedom teach said
it's on hour of the week when fail isnt just an opt it's a learn opportunity
it's get kid to learn on their own and becom lifelong learn said joy kir emy born's teach in arlington height illino and a geni hour evangelist
they're not going to hav teach to help them throughout life
they'r going to be on their own
selling the ide to par inspir by a talk about design think in schools kir beg in febru 2012 to ded on class period each week to student-driven learning
she didnt giv it a nam she simply told stud she want to try someth diff to enco mor reading
instead of assign book stud would choos their own and discuss them with the class
some stud wer excit but oth wer confused
two girl act cri kir said
they wer so into grad and being told what to do and they thought quart book project wer fin she said
all i want to do was tak fabr teach assign and mak them mor student-led
those week op read sess evolv into tim for stud to work on project of their own choosing
at first i said let's just read and shar what we read kir said
now she tel them to read be inspir by what you read and act on it an ide she pick up from iow educ erin olson
over tim kir said she recogn the nee to build in mor structure in ord to keep stud on task

upon complet stud shar what they learn in a class presentation
kirr and a colleagu work continu to mak sur the project meet the school's curricul standard espec to mak stud into bet read writ commun and listeners
kirr also learn the import of educ par ear and often
as unfamili as geni hour seem for kid it's ev less famili to adults
kirr reflect on geni hour on her person blog and celebr stud progress on her classroom blog
she includ upd in biweek email to par and off a detail expl dur a curricul night ear in the school year
that's wher she sold emy born's moth on the idea
as a moth of three and substitut teach sar born wond how her kir would man a room of stud work on diff projects
but she found kirr's emphas on one-on-on conf reass has seen the follow-through she said
mrs kir describ conf with kid not to tel them what to do but to lead them in right direct and she has stay tru to that she said
plus she lik that geni hour is ongoing
most of the tim stud complet assign and immedy forget about them
because it's student-driven they mak decid to pivot on their own
sometimes the idea fail and they mov on
they hav to learn to adapt and i lov that sar born said
on a pract level her daught is learn to brainstorm interview peopl writ profess let and collect dat al with a larg goal than just fin a worksheet
perhaps most sign her daught was heartbrok when she had to miss school thi year becaus of snow days
how can you not lov someth that mak yo kid enjoy going to school
she said
early on emy said it wasnt so easy
she struggled to com up with an ide until she and her friend found themselv discuss which sneak brand wer best
th they decid would be the perfect subject to expl on their own
they search for an answ onlin but real that sneak pref was a mat of opinion
so they shift the foc of their project
they cam up with a list of quest and survey students
then with their teacher's help they post an onlin survey and got stud par and teach from oth schools to respond
after a few month of gath opin they hit anoth wal what to do next
they decid to put the sneak through mor empir test with the help of their sci teacher
to get the sneak they wrot let ask for sampl from eight brand that had com up in their surveys
it was intimid at first emy said
never bef had she writ a form let or cal a company to request information
it help me get ov fear of talk to someon import she said
it's help me in so many ways
for on it has help her learn to brainstorm and interact with oth and hav confid in her own idea instead of agr with oth she said
oh and she learn a lot about sneak col and styl mean a lot to consum she discov but comfort support and funct ar import too espec among runners
she was stun to learn that som peopl hav sho just to us on treadmil or on the street
personally she said she's not sold on the ide of multipl sneak for diff purpos but mayb it's wor mor study
selling the ide to stud for stud the toughest part of a person project is com up with the idea
schools just hav train them to think that way teach said
