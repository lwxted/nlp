'tiger mom' tie cult success
cnn when an excerpt from amy chua's soon-to-be-best-selling book battl hymn of the tig moth was publ in the wal street journ in 2011 it caus an uproar
the piec and it provoc headlin why chines moth ar supery kick off a tens discuss about par and particul motherhood
so it's no surpr that her latest book about success and cult group was giv a bit of side-ey ev bef it published
the yal law profess wrot the tripl pack how three unlik trait explain the ris and fal of cult group in americ along with her husband and fellow leg scholar jed rubenfeld
the book has spark controversy about what it tak to be success in america
it has been label as an exampl of new rac and been derid by historians
dear amy chu  jed rubenfeld tweet hist david leonard
the 1920s cal and want their rac the back
but chu admit to being surpr by the respons espec sint she mad a point to ste clear of controvers top aft the react to her prevy book
i felt lik it would be thought-provoking
 we'r gonn say that at thi point in tim certain group ar outperform oth and we want to expl thos group and why they ar she said
why should that be so explosive
cnn read the book and crit and sat down with chu and rubenfeld to discuss the swirl of controversy set in mot ev bef most peopl had read the book
the definit of success what the book say thi book is about the ris and fal of groups
it thes is that when three distinct forc com togeth in a group's cult they propel that group to disproport success
unfortunately there's a dark sid to the story as well
the sam forc that boost success also carry deep patholog and thi book is about thos patholog too
why it's controvers the meas of what and who is success crit argu may on be defin in person terms
how doe on rely on numb to tel of such strength and rady of heart
jie-song zhang ask in a wid shar huffington post piece
in the atl olg khaz writ success for the auth seem to hov somewh in the nex of money fam and power
what the auth say wel no
1 we defin success as achiev yo goal whatev they ar rubenfeld said
we foc on mat success in the book for two reason on becaus it's meas it's someth you can quant and two becaus for a lot of peopl that is a goal
the trait of success what the book say it turn out for al their divers america's overachiev group ar link togeth by three cult common each on of which viol a cor tenet of modern am thinking
for lack of a less terr nam wel cal thes three cult forc tak togeth the tripl package
its el ar a supery complex insec and impuls control
 america's success group tel their memb someth diff you ar cap of gre thing becaus of the group to which you belong but you individ ar not good enough so you nee to control yourself resist tempt and prov yourself
why it's controvers i've profil six billionair and i didnt pick up on any of thos traits
confidence and driv ye and mayb a touch of supery ov their rivals
but inadequacy
i dont think so wrot forb staff writ sus adam who tak issu with the trait described
what the auth say the real surpr was that in thes vast diff group from tot diff part of the world we found three cult common ov and ov again rubenfeld said
and not just a pattern but invary every singl case
and that was what was so amaz to us and i think that's what mad us writ the book
triple pack cult what the book say but the dirty secret is that the group enjoy disproport success in americ do not tel themselv we'r as good as oth people
they tel themselv they're better
in thi paradox sens eq isnt fair to african-americans
superiority is the on nar that americ has relentless deny or ground out of it black population
why it's controvers by defin trait that mak diff cult group success in americ the book also highlight rel less success group couch in very meas terms
speaking of afr am the book stat ov and ov afr am hav refut and fought back against the nar of infery that the unit stat tri to impos on them but it leg persists
they go on to expl thi them us quot from sean diddy comb and oth success african-americans
writer mary curt say the select of comb as a spokesperson is a warn of a faul argu their assess of the hist civil right mov that free al am to be their best selv and challeng americ to liv up to it found principl and real it prom is wil dumbfound clueless curt writ in the washington post's she the peopl blog
who could view the photo and newsreel of brav men wom and childr and conclud that the mov took away hop for a 'superiority nar by striving for eq und the law
what the auth say we ar absolv not say that any cult is supery to any others
we act stat that in the book chu said
what we say is that at thi point in tim som ar doing bet than oth that doesnt mean they ar better
o book is fil with fact and statistics
i think if we com to the point wher  you cant cit a stat without being accus of stereotyp and cult rac it's going to be real hard to learn she said
you know we hav intract problem of poverty and educ and yet som group ar stil man to ris mor than others
and i think wil blind that would be real unfortunate
a new rac what the book say that certain group do much bet in americ than oth as meas by incom occup stat test scor and so on is difficult to talk about
in larg part thi is becaus the top feel rac charged
why it's controvers by gen and hon in on group the book's argu subscrib to a groupthink that is ethnoc think writ larg auth suketu meht argu in tim magazine
th root of alleg supery hav chang ov tim from rac to class to iq to relig and now to culture
additionally hist profess el d wu writ of her concern that the the book perpetu the 'model min myth and  the not that as ar cult ev genet endow with the charact that en them to success in am society
what the auth say it was disappoint to me when tim magazin jump on board that freight train of crit rubenfeld said
i would say that that show an unwil to read our book fair becaus i think anyon who read our book fair wil see what we'r saying
there's noth rac about the success group in our account of it
the ide that there's rac in our book is ridiculous
we show we prove-that the peopl success in the unit stat today hav al diff skin col rubenfeld said
there ar peopl from every rac and many diff relig and many diff background succeeding
moreover the group chang ov time
we'v writ a book about the qual that propel success the group we say ov and ov chang ov tim sometim in just two generations
chua ad again cont to what's out ther our book act explod thes model min stereotyp  becaus we say ther ar al thes stereotyp about as but aft on or two gen they dont al want to do math and sci and they do not outperform the students
so it's very much an immigr phenomenon
the am dream what the book say americ off exceiv upward mobl to an exceiv numb of immigr and their childr which is why so many peopl want to com here
this phenomenon demand at and subst comply the claim that upward mobl is dead in the unit states
at the oth end of the spectr for many non-immigrant group in americ poverty is deeply entrenched
for exampl owsley county kentucky in the heart of appalach is on of the poorest county  in the contin unit states
why it's controvers in a chapt that examin mobl in americ and the tripl pack the heart of appalach is not as a cult that is not upward mobile
th auth ar quick to emphas appalach cult is not a tripl pack cult but that's not the caus of appalach poverty
this point is so import we'r going to rep it the abs of the tripl pack did not caus poverty in appalachia
critics say the book doe not deeply examin institut barry to econom success instead rely on the tripl pack trait to explain overcom obstacles
it' an intrigu lin of thought but the argu on hold in an imagin world wher cult institut and soc structures mov independ and hav littl bear on each oth and people's abl to success or ev surv in lif julian hing writ in colorlines
what the auth say as to wheth the book is prescrib or describ it's definit not a simpl how to book
i think it's quit a subtl expl of what gen driv and what ar the cost of success chu said
but ye at the end you know we hav a coupl thing to say
one i think we feel that mor impuls control in americ wouldnt be a bad thing
this term supery complex is  so load and we talk al about how dang it is chu said
but what we say at the end is the on kind of supery that is wor aspir to as a nat is a sens of supery bas on the fact that we ar a nat that respect eq and opportun for everybody
