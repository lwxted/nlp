she is a part-time master's stud of cre writ at oxford university
cnn i hav spent mor than a decad of my profess car on intern televid my fac vis to mil each day
yet i hav spent a lifetim hiding
for year i guard a pain secret i cant bear to look in the mirror
i shrink from bright light
a gaz that ling a second too long mak me panic
a hot sum day send me into the shadows
i hav fish-like scales
there ar tiny red island flo on the surfac of my skin
they combin to cre contin with jag surfaces
they turn black and start to smell
there is blood and pus
my scalp spit out silv flakes
my ear ar fil with crusts
i leav whit speck wherev i sit
i flo in long loos clothes
my hand betray me
th sor sit openly
my nail ar dent with pockmarks
i find strands of hair on the sheet and pillowcas every morning
i suff from psoriasis
it' rav my body sint i was 8
at it worst my plaqu look lik leprosy
i feel lik a leper
please can you leav the pool a wom ont told me when i was 22 visit the dead sea in israel we'r not comfort with you in it
she is horr at my body
i am ashamed
i hang my head
the landscap from my neck down is chaos
so i choos to look away
i am abl to dress perfect in the dark
i can feel my way around a room or a closet ful of clothes
i instinct choos the dimmest corn of a resta to sit in
winters ar a reliev on becaus i wont stand out cov from top to toe
mor stacy london on battl skin sham with fash my fac is flawless
not a blemish
not a mark
compliments ar endless
but i am acut aw that a hor film unfold in secret benea my clothes
i am effervesc and rady on the outsid and rot inside
which is the real me
th camera fir up the red light turn on
i am splendidly mad up
i los myself in the moment
i am energized
i am focused
it's on my face
it is floating
it's al that exists
it giv me confidence
no on has it all
i fight my body and myself al my life
i hit rock bottom many tim becaus of my disease
it seem futil to try anymore
who wil ev want me lik thi i cry hyst at home
no on could ev touch me
my moth pul me out self-loathing and defeatism
when i want to giv up she wil not let me
sh becom an expert on psoriasis
she read med journ and approach altern healers
she tak me for acupunct and hypnosis
she mix vary acid in a lab for me to us on my skin and soak me in a tub ful of dead sea salt
the rest of the day i am in a messy smel cream
endless person research tri and er bring occas relief
imagine the nightm teen years
i cow from clos friendships
no on can know the truth
i nev date
intimacy is out of the question
i hav no sens of touch
the scal ar too thick
the itch is unbearable
i try and ign it
it's impossible
it agit me
i us al my strength and i tear at my skin
i am violent
i scratch back and for until ther is blood
it is too raw to do any more
i am fil with rag and humiliated
so i disappear in my head cre fict story and characters
i play out entir convers liv and death story of cour and coward to escap myself
my mind is liv a sep lif from the body benea it
somehow my imagin tak me far
i am in my ear 20s and it's the begin of my career
i am anch the prim tim show in kenya
tonight is a big opportunity
my gam fac is on
i've spent the afternoon on hair and makeup
as i settl into the anchor's chair i hear the faint rustl of plast shrink wrap
i hav wrap up my leg and torso in the clingy film aft soak my scal in vaselin so that the pain is less and the putrid smel contained
the direct cal out
the flo man cue me
th light on new cop in my hand i smil and welcom mil of keny into the studio
the contrast is sharp behind clos door i hav giv up
i am on the floor
i am cry screaming and itch insanely
my moth cries
i rar see her cry
the last tim was when my grandfath died
then an angel arrives
a famy friend approach mum
your daught look unwell
she is los her hair
what is the matter
my moth at her wit end tel the wom the truth
george the angel says
tell her to go to george
georg is a smal town in sou africa
i learn ther is a clin that spec in tre sev skin disease
i adam refuse
i hav had enough of doct hospit foul smel top cream and hop dashed
mum convint me
in a week i find myself ther against my wishes
i withstand the indign ont again of being nak the grotesqu les und neon light and i list to the shock gasp of the doct and nurses
we've nev seen it thi bad on say in the tiny examin room
i glant dul outsid the window of my room to see a blu lak and a blu sky amid green tre and grass
postcard perfect
i count the hours
who could imagin wher i am
i am a celebr in nairob mak it big
what do you do
i am asked
nothing i respond curt to any on who dar mak convers with me
i certain dont want to start a convers about being on televid or host a radio show for that matter
what would my view on ktn and list on capit fm radio think of me
mind body and spirit ar the foc at thi clinic
it sound ins to me
i am told to do medy deep relax and cre vis three tim a day
i lie on the flo list to the voic in charge
every day in every way i am get bet and better
i hav no desir to eat the food i know ar bad for me
i brainwash myself
it works
i eat yogurt or bran for breakfast salad or fish for lunch and chick for dinner
nothing tast good
i yearn for tabasco
i drink on herb tea and tor of water
i writ a long let to my psorias describ how it caus me pain how it hurt my rel how it mak me weak
i blam it for not allow me to be free
i blam it for my rag my viol my bul and my in to feel lov for my nee for pra and const reassurance
i ber and belittl it
i coax and cajol it
i remind it of my sexless life
i beg and plead for it to go away
then i thank my psoriasis
it has taught me to hav no van mor compass and to withhold judgment
i am cry emot drain and hot undernea my long sleev and jeans
i tak a shovel pick a spot outsid and dig deep
i plac the pag into the hole
i plant a tree
i us my hand to touch the earth
nature seem surpr reassuring
in thi inst i bury my past
i hav said everyth i nee to say to my skin
the tre wil giv lif oxygen
perhaps it wil giv me a chant to breath again
a breakthrough
it has been two week and i see someth no on els can see a tiny shift
in the cent of on thick plaqu ther is a slight thinning
i can discern thi littl dent on becaus i hav been touch my skin
this smal success galv me to stick rigid to the tough diet i hav prom to undertake
i am ecst ful of new energy
my smil is real
i am positive
i return to nairob with a new mindset a sens of control
i maintain the regim lik a milit staff sergeant
every 28 day i see progress
it is small
but it is there
th month pass
the smel stops
the cent of the les disappear lik smal mountain collaps on themselves
they turn from red to pink to white
i watch with fascin the metamorphos of my skin
the contin on my body mov apart with the seism chang in my mind
the scal no long build
then they ar gone
i cant believ it
it has been six months
i am clear
i am in remission
i hav no scales
i am normal
i am fin free
and ther is no medication
only food
let food be thy medicin and medicin be thy food
when i walk triumph into my dermatologist's off she is startled
i heal myself with the pow of my mind i announce
sh is shocked
she lat tel me she believ ther is a plac for nat heal in medicine
i cant say what wil work for oth but i believ that diet mindset and a wond support system wer the best long-term answ for me
ther is a plac for light therapy or steroid cream or biolog med but back then i heal myself from the insid out
after my transform my famy tak me to mombas on the keny coast
i dont dread it for the first tim in my life
i hav a new bikin dark blu with a yellow rim
i hav nev worn one
it is so soft
it feel feminine
i hav nev felt lik a wom the way i do when i put it on
