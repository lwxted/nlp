after al you've flak out a few tim yourself and it's not lik yo friend's doing it on purpos to hurt you

upwave why do we misplac things
the verdict friend who flak out too oft ar disrespect yo tim and sabot themselv we dont want to think that flaky friend ar being malicy ev on a subconscy level but the tru is the spont free-spirit behavy known as flak out isnt real al that benign
it act rev a sery lack of conscienty and ther ar a few reason why someon could be act thi way
some peopl just cant say no so they say ye in the begin then back out say andre bony a clin psycholog at georgetown univers in washington dc and auth of the friend fix
it's a class they feel guil say no and they're afraid of conflict so they just agr to everything
but you know that lat on they're just going to be too busy or too stressed and get out of it with som lam excuse
upwav 3 way to mast the art of say no in most cas flak hav poor time-management skil and think they can do everyth in an illog short tim period
a lot of peopl overestim their abl observ stev bergla a psychotherap and auth of yo own worst enemy understand the paradox of self-defeating behavior
they overburd themselv and dont leav tim to be prep for crit task so they fail
it's self-handicapping behavior
but flaky behavy doesnt just hurt the flakes
it oft ind that they dont respect yo tim or ev that they secret feel their tim is mor import than yours
these peopl ar a littl mor self-centered and rar put themselv in the sho of the host not bonior
upwave how to cre healthy bound ign const flaky can do a friend mor harm than good in the long run when someone's not depend it's hard to trust them
but bef you confront a flaky friend it's import to fig out wheth he or she is an unwit flak or wheth someth dark is going on
you hav to look at if the person is consist say berglas
if a person is alway lat then it's not noxy or intentional
but when they're on sometim lat to mak you wait for them and on when the situ doesnt direct benefit them then they're try to est power
that's being manip and aggressive
it's not al bad new though flaky friend lik good win oft improv with tim bergla says
age teach them that if they dont chang their flaky way bad thing wil hap eg their friend wont includ them in fut plans
the key is for the flak to real they nee to invest in their commun and famy by being conscienty and keep to their commitments
upwave challeng get ov a grudg already
when it com to perpet flak thos who nev real they hav a problem you may want to stag an intervention
but rememb in most cas flak ar conscy try to disrespect you
so tak car when set them straight or you could ruin yo friendship
bonior suggest turn the convers inward and focus on how their lat disrupt yo lif and mak you feel undervalued
then heap pra on them when they do show up on time
a littl posit reinforc now could sav you a lot of frust in the future
