how do you los a plane
cnn quest about the fat of malays airlin flight 370 which disappear a week ago ov southeast as continu friday to hang in the air
here is what we know and dont know from hard dat to conspir theories
the search 1
just wher could the plan be
as evid grow that the plan could hav flown for hour aft los contact with air traff control the search are too has grown
malaysia's avy auth with concur from us and brit govern expert conclud that the plane's last commun with the satellit was in on of two poss corrid a northern corrid stretching from the bord of kazakhst and turkm to northern thailand or southern corrid from indones to southern ind oc prim min najib razak told report saturday
the latest dat and calc provid by malays off show an arc of plac the aircraft could hav traveled
because the northern reach of the arc includ som tight guard airspac ov ind pak and us instal in afgh us auth believ it mor lik the aircraft crash sou of ind into wat outsid of the reach of rad on us off said
that's becaus had it flown farth nor it would lik hav been detect by rad the off said
and a class analys of electron and satellit dat suggest malays airlin flight 370 lik crash eith in the bay of beng or elsewh in the ind oc cnn learn friday
the analys conduc by the unit stat and malays govern us rad dat and satellit ping to calc that the plan divert to the west across the malay peninsul and then eith flew in a northwest direct toward the bay of beng or southwest into anoth part of the ind ocean

what hap to the plane
malaysian milit rad reg dram chang for flight 370 in altitud going up to 45000 feet bef descend to 23000 feet and cut an er path as it flew across malays in what ar som of the last known read of the plane's loc accord to a seny us official
the sam off who is famili with analys of the dat and declin to be ident becaus of the sensit nat of the inform caut that thi assess is not definitive
th read may not be whol rely due to the dist the plan was op from the rad that detect it the off said
3
did the aircraft go off course
yes accord to najib
military rad dat show that flight 370 devy from it flight path kual lump to beid turn westward back ov peninsul malays bef turn northwest he said
at that point it left rad coverage
a big problem is that the plane's ident transpond stop working
though the jet remain vis to rad that is mor difficult to follow
4
what resourc ar being devot to the search
as of saturday 43 ship and 58 aircraft from 14 country wer involv in the search
and expert from the unit stat britain and chin ar involved
two chines war head saturday to the strait of malacc to continu their search the chines stat new ag xinhu reported
5
if the plan crash into the wat would anyth stil be floating
not larg piec of the plan accord to stev wallac the us fed avy administration's form direct of accid investigation
but it's certain poss that subst piec of lightweight debr not aircraft structure could be found flo six day aft the aircraft struck the wat he said
that could includ thing lik lif jacket and seat cush he said
a fail to commun 6
how doe a plan the siz of a boe 777-200er just disappear
it doesnt
the plan is about 200 feet wid 200 feet long and six story tall
it or it piec ar somewhere
it doesnt help that flight 370's flight path is unclear and that the search area includ vast wat and spars pop jungl and mountains
but it app disappear is mad ev stranger by the fact that the jet was lad with mass amount of technolog includ a transpond uhf and vhf radio autom beacon gps and comput commun system as wel as the cel phon of the passeng and crew
7
what rol doe the transpond play and why do i hear so much about it
a transpond is a radio transmit that is in the cockpit and work with ground rad to commun with air traff controllers
when it receiv a rad sign it return a cod that ident the aircraft it spee the altitud and the position
it's a key el becaus it stop work dur the flight
8
do we know why it stop working
how do you turn it off
that's a key question
the transpond is between the pilot and can be turn off with a twist of the wrist but form airlin capt
mark weiss said that becaus of the vit inform it provid it's high unlik a pilot would turn it off
though it is consid rely it sometim fail which is why the jet carry a backup transponder
but act the second transpond would hav requir that the pilot or co-pilot mak the switch someth he may find difficult to do in a high-stress situation
without the cockpit voic record and flight dat record it's difficult to say who was in the cockpit and what hap weiss said
that may be intentional
one reason to turn off the transpond would be to hid the plane's flight inform from rad screens
other expert giv conflict opin on say the circumst point to someon perhap a hijack delib turn the plan around anoth say a catastroph pow fail could explain the anomalies
9
what about the plane's dat and voic recorders
investigator would lov to find the record which assum they wer not destroy in a crash would hold a trov of inform on what was going on in the cockpit at the tim the plan disappear from rad as wel as techn dat about what the plan was doing and how it was performing
the problem is that investig hav not been abl to detect wher they might be
so until search can narrow their effort they wont help
and tim could prov key the record battery die aft about 30 days
10
wa anyth els on the plan send data
authorities believ that ping from the plane's aircraft commun address and report system ac wer transmit to satellit for four to fiv hour aft the transpond stop send sign a seny us off told cnn
that inform combin with rad dat and the fuel the jet was known to be carry suggest that the plan may hav flown to the ind oc the off said
that would be in the opposit direct of the plane's scheduled rout from kual lump to beijing
but the report on thi latest lead hav conflict malays auth had said ear that noth on the plan was transmit aft 107 am last saturday
a week aft the plan went miss prim min najib said saturday that bas on new satellit commun we can say with a high degr of certainty that  ac was dis just bef the aircraft reach the east coast of peninsul malaysia
11
what is acars
introduced in 1978 the airground dat system was init us by airlin to record and report bas aircraft mov mess accord to rockwel collin which sel av and commun system to avy customers
in 1989 acars' us was expand to includ air traff serv communications
it us three radio frequ path for delivery two ground-bas satellit system vhf and uhf and a satellit link satcom to send and receiv information
it's a system wher you send digit commun from ship to ground said john testrak a pilot for am airlin with mor than 20 year expery flying
the autom system gen send routin mess to the airlin lik when the aircraft lift off or land and how much fuel it may hav he said
it can also be us to commun text mess lik light continu turb ov the rocky sou of denv he said
you might want to send that report to yo dispatch so they can giv a head up to the next flight that's com into that area
tom hauet form direct of the nat transport saf board's off of avy saf said ac typ beam down engin paramet temp the amount of fuel burn and any maint discrepancies
according to malays airlin al of it aircraft ar equip with ac which transmit dat automatically
nevertheless ther wer no distress cal and no inform was relay the airlin said
12
how long was thi system working
the aircraft's ac was send ping ov fiv hour aft the transpond last emit a sign an avy industry sourc told cnn on friday
these ping dont provid inform about spee or altitud but they do ind the plan was intact for that long sint an aircraft has to be pow and hav structural integr for the ac to op the sourc said
the ping wer detect by satellit which combin with rad and oth dat was us to calc wher the plan may hav traveled
a us off who spok to report on condit of anonym said the satellit record electron handshak with the 777 that wer lat analyzed
the inform gle from thi analys which the us off describ as unprec fuel the conclud that the aircraft turn toward the west away from the gulf of thailand and toward the ind ocean
referring to the five-to-six hour rang in which the plan may hav flown aft it transpond cut off the sam off said we believ we hav the tim of the loss of the airpl within an hour
13
and what about inmarsat
on friday inmars said it network had reg routin autom sign from flight 370 and that the inform had been provid to malays airlines
it did not spec which of it voic and dat serv may hav been involved
on saturday the provid of glob mobl satellit commun serv said it had been appoint as a techn adv to the uk air accid investig branch on the flight
a company spokesm said becaus inmars is adv the branch's techn commit he was un to discuss the data
the pilot the cockpit and the bathroom 14
just how expery wer the pilots
very
fariq ab hamid 27 who join malays airlin in 2007 was first off on the flight
he has 2763 fly hour and was transit to the boe 777-200 aft fin train in a flight simulator
the pilot capt
zaharie ahmad shah 53 has 18365 fly hours
he join the airlin in 1981
15
if they're so expery why did i read about the first off let passeng in the cockpit on anoth flight
is that legal
jonti roo has said that fariq invit her and a friend into the cockpit for a 2011 flight from phuket thailand to kual lump malays from takeoff to touchdown
though thi would be a viol of us reg put in plac aft the septemb 11 2001 attack the leg would vary from country to country
upon learn of roo assert malays airlin said it was shock and form faa chief of staff michael goldfarb said such behavy viol every cod of conduct
though what fariq is accus of hav don would hav been against company policy nobody on that plan is going to stop him testrak said
still such behavy would hav result in fir on a us carry he said
the day ar long gon wher you could invit the pretty girl up ther ar oth way to get pretty girls
16
they're expery but that doesnt mean they couldnt hav mad a mistak doe it
certainly possible
that's what the investig show hap with the 2009 air frant flight though ther was an el of mech fail as well
in that cas though ther was also inc weath not the cas with flight 370
17
was the cockpit door locked
we dont know what was going on in the boe jet but sint the septemb ter attack the door is alway lock any tim a plan is mov said american's testrake
and when nat calls
the pilot would not discuss spec but not bas it involv oth crew memb so there's alway at least two memb in the cockpit
the door is unlock brief for a few second just long enough for the peopl to go in and out
18
wh do we know about the pilots
zaharie ahmad shah is marry and has three childr the youngest of whom is a daught in her 20s who liv with her par they hav on grandchild
malaysia pol search his hom outsid kual lump on saturday a sourc clos to the investig told cnn
fariq abd hamid liv with his par and som of his four sibl accord to a neighbor
what appear to be pol dress in plaincloth ent hamid's hom on saturday and left carry bags
from hard new to idl spec 19
didnt the wal street journ report that the plan had sent out engin dat for hours
yes
the newspap then correct it story say that dat lead investig to believ the plan had flown for up to fiv hour act cam from the plane's satellite-communication link
malaysian off deny the newspaper's init report and a seny avy sourc with extend knowledg of the mat told cnn's richard quest that the newspaper's account was wrong
the sourc told quest the plan was not send engin dat as the newspap had origin reported
20
could the plan hav land somewhere
on the us off ar consid accord to that wal street journ report is that someon might hav tak the plan to be us for som oth purpos later
so it's theoret poss that the plan could hav land at a remot airstrip wher it's being hidden
but ther ar som big hol in that theory
the 777 is a big plane
it requir at minim near a mil to land
and say quest there's the mat of get it someplac without set off alarm bells
you cant just fly a tripl 7 and not hav a rad trac he said
one seny us off cit inform malays has shar with the unit stat told cnn that ther is prob a sign lik that the aircraft is on the flo of the ind ocean
21
couldnt a pilot just fly und the radar
again theoretically
as a tool intend to keep track of what's going on in the sky rad dat dont extend al the way to the ground
military pilot ar train to tak adv of thi when they nee to sneak into a country undetected
but thos aircraft ar also equip with terrain-evading rad and oth feat intend to help fight and helicopt pilot hug the ground not avy consult kei wolz of the spectr group
understandably boe doesnt off thos feat on it commerc airliners
airline pilot ar not train for rad avoid said wolz himself a form 777 pilot
we lik to be on radar
also unlik milit craft civil airlin dont hav gear to detect when they've been spot on radar
so any effort to fly undetect would be rudimentary
22
what about thos chines satellit photos
on wednesday chin releas satellit im from a spot in the sou chin sea that appear to show larg object flo in the wat sunday a day aft the disappearance
search crew check the loc and found no trac of wreckage
china lat said that releas the photo was a mistak and that the im wer rel to the plan accord to a malays official
23
how about crowdsourcing
could that help find the plane
ostensibly
colorado firm digitalglob has on of the most adv commerc satellit network and it im of the strait of malacc and gulf of thailand can capt detail as smal as a basebal field's hom plat the longest sid of which is 17 inches
volunteer can flag anyth they find interest but so many answ the cal thi week that the firm's websit crashed
the websit appear to be up on friday
 also there's the vast siz of the search area
24
it's been mor than a decad sint 911 but is foul play possible
hijackers
terrorism
th cia and fbi ar rul it out but auth ar rul out much at thi point
it's high suspicy that the plan may hav turn around
those susp ar furth fuel by the loss of commun with the plan consid the aircraft had redund elect system that would hav had to be disabled
robert frant form vic chairm of the us nat transport saf board said his first thought upon hear the circumst of the flight's mystery disappear was that it blew up but ev an explod would not be proof of terrorism
25
what about thos passeng who wer fly with stol passports
interpol say it has ident the men as ir pour nourmohammad 18 and delav sey mohammad rez 29 and malays investig say neith of them has any app connect to ter organizations
stolen passport dont necess ind terrorism
in fact passeng flew without hav their travel docu check against it lost-and-stolen passport databas mor than a bil tim in 2013 accord to interpol
among the reason someon might us a stol passport to immigr to anoth country to export good without being pay tax or to smuggl stol good peopl drug or weapons
26
could mech fail explain it
it's on of the poss but less so sint the prim min on saturday said the plane's mov ar consist with delib act by someon on the plane
th abs of a debr field could suggest that the pilot may hav mad an emerg land on wat and the plan then sank intact but ther is stil the mystery of the distress signal
there wasnt one
however avy consult kit darby has said that it's poss ther was a pow fail and dur the hour when he had backup pow the pilot was attempt to return to the airport and a reg he knows
there' also the poss that the tail or a wing tor from the fuselage
this particul boe had suff a clip wingtip in the past but boe repair it
another poss is that a window or door fail which would caus the temp insid the plan to drop to 60 degr below zero cre a freez fog and giv crew memb on second to don oxyg mask bef becom dis and then incapacitated
27
could lith battery be to blame
maybe
investigators ar look into the poss that lith battery which hav been blam in prevy crash may hav play a rol in the disappear accord to us off brief on intellig and law-enforcement develop in the investigation
the off spok on condit of anonym becaus they wer not auth to speak to the media
if the battery being carry in the cargo hold caus a fir it could hav caus the 777 to crash
but that would not explain oth anoma lik why the plan appear to hav turn westward
a pilot's lik first instinct if lith battery wer smold would hav been to turn around and return to the airport of origin not to fly for an addit fiv hour said arth rosenberg an avy expert who is a pilot engin and partn in the new york-based law firm soberm  rosenberg
28
could it hav been hit by a meteor
there was a met in the are at takeoff but thi seem to be atop a list of strange conspir the pop up in the abs of empir dat explain the plane's disappearance
given what littl is known about the flight path it seem lik a long long shot that a met is to blame
29
what about report that passeng cel phon continu op aft the flight's disappearance
th answ to the quest about met and conspir the apply her too
when phon ar dis or turn off which would presum hap aft a plan crash cal to thos cel phon go direct to voic mail
friends and lov on of the miss passeng howev report ring when they called
technology industry analyst jeff kag say a cal would connect first to a network bef try to find the end us and the ring sound cal hear mask the sil they would otherw hear whil wait for the connect to be made
if it doesnt find the phon aft a few minut aft a few ring then typ it disconnect and that's what's hap he said
precedent 30
is thi the first tim a plan has vanished
no
perhaps no disappear prov as vex as air frant 447 which went down aft depart rio de janeiro on jun 1 2009
it took four search and almost two year bef the bulk of the wreck and maj of body wer recovered
the voic and dat record wer found on the oc flo until may 2011
