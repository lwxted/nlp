cnn sometim the crash sit is nev found
in 1972 a pan alask airway flight with on pilot and three passeng took off from anch bound for juneau plan to fly the rout und vis flight rul despit bad weath conditions
after on last contact with air traff control the cessn was on it way
the plan nev reach juneau
the flight had two congressm on board hal bog of louisian and nichola begich of alaska
the search for the miss aircraft was intens encompass 325000 squ mil of land and sea with 3600 flight hour us to look for the wreckage
but aft 39 day the search was cal off
a nat transport saf board report acknowledg that the caus might nev be known
in the cas of malays flight 370 a boe 777 miss sint saturday a search of an are capt by chines satellit im that seem to pinpoint the crash sit turn up nothing
such im ar rar and typ when a plan goe down in a remot are with no wit on of the most cruc tool avail to investig is radar
it's very import said john griffin ii an assocy profess at embry-riddle aeronaut univers who spec in air traff control
there ar bas two way to find a plan rad and pilot communication
radar can tak two forms
one is prim rad what's sometim cal skinpaint that simply reflect off an object
primary rad doesnt giv any inform about the object it's tracking
if you work at an atc air traff control facil on an east coast flyway you wil pick up flock of bird griffin said
primary rad can also pick up debr that might be rain down from an in-flight explod and in such cas a target that appear as on object sud appear as sev objects
secondary rad on the oth hand rely on plane's transpond a dev loc in the nos of the plane
th transpond broadcast a sign to air traff control that ident the flight and it altitude
secondary rad is mor than just a blip on a rad screen it tel the control the valu inform about the spec aircraft
malaysia flight 370's transpond stop broadcast about 45 minut into the flight
 that point air traff control in kual lamp had no mor contact with the aircraft
 first the search are focus on the plane's intend flight path as off went on the assum that the plan did not chang course
then they start expl oth poss griffin said
military rad track unident target that could hav been flight 370 head west toward the strait of malacc and poss beyond
military rad can cov area not cov by civil air traff control
but without the plane's transpond work that target track by rad is on skinpaint or the reflect of a dens object
it cant ident the plan or giv an altitude
and ev the rad can on provid so much information
it's poss for a plan to lit fly und the rad becaus cov us doesnt go al the way down to the surface
in that cas a plan could continu undetect ev in area cov by radar
in addit to the 1972 alask crash oth aircraft hav gon miss without a trace
in 1962 a fly tig lin lockhee constel op as a milit transport disappear ov the pac aft tak off from guam
the recovery op includ 48 aircraft but no sign of the plan was ev found
officials deny malays airlin jet kept fly for hour in the cas of the malays airlin flight the search are has continu to expand rath than contract someth that expert say doe not bod wel for the lik of find the plane
on wednesday malays auth broad the search are to 27000 naut squ mil near doubl it size
on thursday auth said they plan to look farth west toward the ind ocean
it's almost imposs to simply crisscross such a larg are in low-flying plan and boats
it' a monu task griffin said
it's a vast area
there's a lot of terrain ther remot area wher the plan could hav crashed
after the alask crash congress mand that gen avy aircraft carry an elt or emerg loc transmitter
the elt is design to act dur a crash and broadcast a sign to an emerg frequ monit by air traff controllers
international civil avy auth requir that intern flight such as the kual lumpur-beijing flight hav elt on board
it's not clear howev if the malays airlin plan had the dev on board
if it did hav an elt it hasnt been detect and that could mean that the plan crash in such a remot loc that it sign is out of rang or that the dev malfunct or didnt go off becaus the plan act land somewh safely
but then you get into how do you hid a 777 griffin said
this is a sery aircraft
seriously big
the boe 777's tail alon stand 60 feet high
but right now it's a 200-foot-long 500000-pound needl in a haystack that could be as larg as an ocean
