world's 'first airport' larg unknown
wright-patterson air forc bas ohio cnn an old wood shack and row of tilt fent post in a way thi desert littl patch of midwestern dirt was the start point for every airport in the world
on a cold winter's day i scan a snowy lon field nor of dayton ohio
not sur exact wher i am i wond for a minut if i'm lost
a nat park serv sign mak it clear what i'm look at the first airport
exploring huffm prairy fly field
wait
back up
i dont think i knew about that
like mil of oth am i was taught that the wright broth work their fly mag in a plac cal kitty hawk nor carolina
then it hit me what i'd stumbl onto was the wright outdo lab wher they took pow flight to the next level
this 84-acre past is wher mrs wright's boy let themselv screw up
by learn from each misstep they wer abl to develop a pract and us machin said park rang robert petersen
this is the holy grail he said
this is lit wher avy get it start
related wer the wright broth real first
after the broth mad hist at kitty hawk they schlepped mor than 600 mil back to dayton with a contrapt that could fly 852 feet in 59 seconds
that was cool and al  but folk wer wond could an improv aircraft do more
could it transport peopl from city to city
maybe
could it help defend democr in a world war
perhaps
the broth and their employ had their work cut out for them
between 1904 and 1916 accord to peters and the nat park serv a sery of avy first took plac at huffm prairy first control turn first circ first control bank first figure-eight the world's first perm flight school was est her said petersen
-- among the first stud was henry hap arnold who would becom the on five-star gen in the hist of the us air force
-- anoth stud was calbrai perry rodg who in 1911 becam the first pilot to fly coast to coast
-- the first cargo flight took plac out of huffm prairy said petersen
as publ for a retail shop a wright aircraft flew sev bolt of clo to columb about 55 mil away
so yeah peters said
it is the world's first airport
hold on now
other expert ar so sur about that word airport
that's not real an airport said hist deborah dougla cur of sci and technolog at the mit museum
an airport has to do two thing get airpl in and out of the sky saf and it has to transf peopl and good from on mod of transport to another
if you're not doing thos thing then i'd say you're not real an airport
no oth plac as far as i can tel cal itself the first airport
college park airport a tiny facil outsid washington dc has a good shot at the claim said douglas
however it avoid the controversy by simply cal itself the oldest contin op airport in the world
if someon say first airport in americ you could argu kitty hawk said chelse dorm program coordin at the colleg park avy museum
but we'v been fly her sint 1909 and that's our distinction
related story wer the wright broth real first
another airport pearson field which serv southwestern washington stat say it start four year bef colleg park in 1905 as a land facil for a blimp
but it websit cal it on of the oldest op field in the us
the act word airport wasnt us until 1919 when a newspap coin it to describ atl city new jersey's bad field which op in 1910
now clos bad was the first municip airport in the us for both land and seapl accord to the fed avy administration
for academ hist we find that first ar real real hard to est dougla say with a laugh
they're hard to know
related world's most terr airport whatev the cas by the end of the first decad of the 20th century americ nee mor land and takeoff loc to support us air mail deliveries
that spur the cre of airfield in new york and philadelphia
across the atl europ avy wer est prototyp airport too
spurred by world war i city ther ev est london's croydon airport berlin's templehoff and le bourget in paris
back in ohio the wright fac a few surpr challenges
the landown allow the wright to us the field und the condit that they mov the hors and cow out of the way first said petersen
sometimes ther wer issues
another problem how to get airborne
th plane's engin wer much mor pow than engin for rid lawn mowers
nature wasnt alway coop either
ohio wind ar quit as gusty as the beach of kitty hawk
solution us a catapult
here's how it work the plan sat at on end of a 240-foot-long wood rail atop a wheel trolley
ropes and pulley connect the trolley to a 1600-pound weight suspend from a 20-foot-tall wood derrick
with the plane's engin revv the weight was drop propel the craft down the rail and on hop into the air
this becom the forerun of catapult system us to launch plan from aircraft carry today peters said
a replic of the catapult derrick stand at the sit along with a replic of the wright hang built on the exact spot of the original
because huffm prairy is part of wright-patterson air forc bas it has remain virt untouch by real est develop said loyol univers chicago hist profess elizabe fraterrigo who research and wrot a pap on the property for the park service
pdf you can real get a sens of what it was lik for the wright broth to work ther she said
you can think about what they accompl at that plac and real feel a connect to it
the field is among fiv dayton-area sit that mak up the dayton avy herit nat hist park includ the wright famy mand and on of the wright bicyc shops
eventually huffm prairy was swallow up by two nearby milit instal patterson field and wilb wright field
later the two merg facil becam wright-patterson air forc bas which has contribut to research and develop of groundbreak adv includ press plan cabin cockpit navig instru and night-vision technology
amazing to think that it al sprouted from the exploit of two broth their bicyc shop and thi hallow piec of farmland
