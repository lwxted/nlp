aquar pump sav babies' lives
cnn when chokonjets was born he weigh just ov 2 pounds
h tiny underdevelop lung struggled for each breath
then doct in the hospit in blantyr malaw put chokonjets on a breath machin mad out of aquar pumps
chokonjetsa is on of doz of newborn in the afr country who hav surv thank to the ingenu of stud in a seny design class at ric univers in houston
the overal surv rat of baby with respir distress at the malaw hospit increas from 44 to 71 with the us of the stud breath machin accord to a rec clin trial
using aquar pump the stud hav design a low-cost vert of a breath dev cal a bubbl cpap or continu posit airway press machine
traditional bubbl cpap system us in develop country can cost upward of 6000 the stud machin can be manufact for around 350 provid big sav for hospit in poverty-stricken areas
malawi has the highest rat of preterm bir in the world 181 per 100 liv birth accord to the world heal organization
babies born too ear oft hav underdevelop lung that dont infl easily
premature baby struggle to breath in part becaus they dont produc enough lung surfact a naturally-produced chem that keep the tiny air sac in the lung cal alveol from collapsing
a lot of thes baby die becaus of the stress struggling to breath put on their bodies
second baby poss cur of hiv in malaw when a newborn is suff from respir distress he or she is typ provid extr oxyg via tub plac gent in the nose
but doct dont ad air press to help infl the infant's lungs
th is the way respir distress was tre in newborn ev in develop country lik the unit stat until the 1970s
with a cpap machin gentl air press is push via tub into the nostril and mou to help facilit breathing
to understand how a bubbl cpap work think of a straw that is part submerg in a glass of water
when you blow into the top of the straw bubbl com out of the bottom of the straw and bubbl up
when lung ar underdevelop it's lik when you're blow up a complet defl balloon and that first brea to infl the balloon is real difficult said dr rebecc richards-kortum of ric univers who help facilit the design of the stud bubbl cpap machine
for a baby with underdevelop lung every brea is lik that
doctors and nurs know that it tak very littl air press to assist newborns
the design stud found that two aquar pump provid the perfect amount of gentl press for del lungs
in the origin prototyp the machin was hous in a clear plast shoebox from target
the device's latest cas box is mad from bent sheet met spec design for us funt and dur said dr mar od of ric univers a co-author of the device's clin tri along with richards-kortum
having us bubbl cpap myself the low-cost aquar pump machin us the sam gen principl said dr andre tremba a neon spec at rainbow baby and children's hospit in cleveland who was not assocy with the device's design
we've found bubbl cpap to be very benef in inf with respir distress
 aft tak a look at the photo the low-cost machin doesnt seem to be very different
jocelyn brown a form stud who help design the low-cost bubbl cpap machin has liv in malaw for almost two years
she is collab with aid org and us a transit grant from usaid in hop of rol out the dev across the country first in govern hospit and then in priv and rur hospitals
so far the machin hav been impl in nin govern hospit she said
mysterious clust of bir defect stump doct brown said on maj challeng to the rollout in malaw is a lack of nurs and phys the high turnov rat mak train difficult
many district hospit hav mayb on doct who may not ev be a neon spec brown said
much of the car is provid by nurs but on nurs could be tak car of 40 paty at a time
another challeng brown explain is that par in malaw ar sometim reluct to allow the bubbl cpap machin to be us perhap becaus nas tub and mask us in respir therapy ar assocy with dea us on extrem il paty receiv breath assistance
fortunately baby chokonjetsa's famy allow him to receiv the respir therapy
his nam which mean thrown away in malawi's chichew langu was chos by his grandmother
she fear he had been thrown away by god as she didnt expect him to survive
but with the help of a breath machin mad of aquar pump chokonjets is now a healthy thriving 7-month-old baby
