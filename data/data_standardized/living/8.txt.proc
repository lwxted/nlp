cnn in two rec study research at florid stat univers expl wheth eat disord ar link to soc med use
th answer
like that most awkward of facebook status say it's complicated
summaries in the intern journ of eat disord describ the research
in the first study 960 colleg wom complet a self-reported eat disord screening assessment
they also answ a sery of quest about their facebook use
a smal but sign posit correl was found between dur of facebook us and disord eating
in the second 84 wom from the first study wer divid into two groups
one group was instruct to us facebook as they typ would for 20 minutes
the oth group was told to research the ocelot a rainforest cat on wikiped and youtube
unsurprisingly the wom who spent 20 minut on facebook report gre body dissatisfact than thos who got to look at cut cat photos
the research show that ther is som connect between facebook us and disord eat risk
i dont believ ther is anyth un problem about facebook as comp to oth soc med platform it's just the platform thes research chose
 but the study do not suggest that soc med platform should be held respons for caus eat disorders
after al we'r talk about a wid spectr of il that hav complex biolog psycholog and cult roots
a simpl blam gam would be sery misguided
we nee mor research to bet understand thi connect and perhap mor import how soc med can be us as a posit tool for outreach ear interv and recovery
i work with colleg stud every day in my job overs the nat eat disord association's you outreach
for thos who struggle with poor body im perfect or anxy just a few of the many risk fact assocy with disord eat soc med can be downright toxic
facebook instagram tumblr twit pinterest and their many new cousin do provid an unprec degr of access to im and mess that can entrench and sometim trig disord eat thought and behaviors
frequent us of soc med can end up feel as though they're altern between broadcast and comparison mod which ar both dang plac to be if you ar pron to believ that yo self-worth is bas on oth approval
when i look at oth people's album on facebook the comp is automatic
i end up feel lik crap
this com cam to me from an 18-year-old who particip in a proud2bme virt roundt on how soc med affect teen body image
it is a senty i hear express const in my work
back when i was caught up in my own eat disord as a teen i us to star at my thigh in the mir wish they could be as thin as thos of model in the pict i tor out of magazines
there wer no hasht lik thighgap which hav turn appearance-related fix into search univers with neverend streams of photo and thinspir text
i want desp to be lik but ther wer no lik or heart for me log on to watch and tally
the point is that the obsess compuls and comparison that driv eat disord ar noth new
social med hav just ampl them
but it also has the pot to ampl solutions
we nee to fig out how we can most effect us it to promot med lit self-acceptance support recovery and body im activism
some might choos to unplug from soc med to protect their ment heal there's a reason that most resid eat disord tre cent ban soc med us among patients
but the real is that most peopl at risk or act struggling with disord eat us soc med in som way
the good new is that soc med giv us al the abl to be cont cur med mak and rabbl rousers
if you want to fil yo fee with mess of body acceiv you can choos pag and account to follow that wil del thos messages
sure i stil hav to report spammy bel bust advert but the cont i see and shar through soc med reflect my valu and interest and i hav no interest in see anyth rel to weight loss or body shaming
rather than consum and intern med tox we can us soc med talk back to a cult that mak us feel lik we'r nev good enough
for exampl 19-year-old benjamin okeef who is recov from anorex start a changeorg petit reprimand abercromby  fitch's ceo for com say the company was int exclud and cal for it to includ plu sizes

just last week was nat eat disord aw week
it was the most success in the organization's hist the nedaw hasht had a reach of 23 mil dur that week and that soc med aw doe transl to an increas in peopl seek help
we saw it in the increas volum of cal to the helplin and visit to the website
w saw it in the story and photo of hop shar on twit tumblr instagram and facebook
social med can stok body dissatisfact and reinforc disord eating
it can also empow individ to us their voic and resist mainstream med mess about beauty and thinness
let' keep work to understand the nuant of thos risk and lev the benefit to build a mov of change
th opin express ar sol thos of clair mysko
