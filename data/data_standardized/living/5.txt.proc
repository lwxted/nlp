want part-time lover
cnn rememb that old tun friday i'm in love
well som dat ar look to mak it a reality
i hav found a wond weekend lov read a testimon by leah 38 on the new dat websit parttimelovecouk
he ask for no mor and the tim we spend togeth ar magical
the sit launch in ear janu is the brainchild of rel auth and blog hel croydon
its target demograph is peopl who want to be independ but also want to fal in lov she says
some may wond wheth part tim lov is simply the newest in a lin of dat sit wher us trol for one-night stands
but the sit isnt just tind with a rom sheen if you believ it market spiel
we ar not a no-strings website
w ar for singl look for regul partn with mut attract genuin friend respect and a mag spark but whom hav no expect of mov in aft three month and valu their fre tim and independ claim the sit which us must opt into via oth mor est dat sites
croydon assert that a low-maintenance or part-time rel is distinct diff than the eloqu nam booty cal or the ev mor lucid cas encount in that the goal is last love
croydon admit it's not for everyone
sh envid her demograph as us in their mid-to-late 30s and ear 40s who ar set in their way and might find it difficult to adapt domest to a new partner
they're real on the fairyt she says
in 2011 writ laur ten wrot a column we'r happy semi-detached in a brit newspap about her part-time cohabit with boyfriend sean walsh
she had just complet a difficult divorc ar they all
she jok in an e-mail with cnn and wasnt sur she ev want to get marry again
what she was sur of was that she and walsh work real wel togeth as the rel stood
they wer liv apart togeth as she cal it
fast forward to 2014 and now ten is eng to marry walsh
over tim sean and i hav becom mor and mor sur that we ar each other's soulm and lif partn she says
and we hav slow but sur got to the point wher we ar ready to mak the ultim commit to each other
but that doesnt mean they each wont hav their alon time
th coupl is plan for walsh to hav a pied--terre but not in the ernest hemingway sense
as it is it is tot work albeit somewh unus she says
we ar work out log at the mom but i reckon we wil liv togeth and sean wil rent a work-live spac nearby wher he can writ sometim sleep and recharg his batteries
croydon expl what she cal low-maintenance rel in her new book screw the fairyt a modern girl's guid to sex and lov in which she debunk the tradit id of the omnipres partner
croydon say she nev want to get marry or hav kids
she' also quit famili with unorthodox dat styl her first book sug daddy diary was about her pench for old men
 you dont hav to see someon three to four night a week to express lov she told cnn ov the phon from london
in every oth aspect of lif we'v gon for conveny independ and wher individ is promot she says
yet you hav thi soc approv model of rel that you liv together
croydon say for it to work the partn emphas is stil on a genuin rel in that ther is rom and spark but without al the monotony and oblig of a full-time relationship
jill web a virginia-based clin psycholog and auth of hav sex want intim why wom settl for one-sided rel say thi particul styl of dat can certain feel empow as it allow dat to compart the relationship
it protect you there's less vuln she says
sooner or lat though she say on or both partn might catch stronger feel and want someth more
ultimately what connect us with on anoth is being vuln she asserts
on the opposit end of the spectr web say it's also import for each partn to feel lik they hav their own life
you should feel saf and at eas in yo rel she say mean that you ar const worry wher yo partn is and vic versa
if that's not the cas a convers about spac is in order
failing that it might be tim to re-evaluat the healthy of the relationship
as for croydon she's stil singl and ready to mingl part-time
