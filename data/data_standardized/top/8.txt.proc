hijack scenario giv hope
cnn in an incid wher noth can be rul out is it a surpr that som rel of the passeng on miss malays airlin flight 370 ar hop it is a hijacking
to som it is a far-fetched conspir the and to oth it repres the on scenario that leav op the poss of see their lov on alive
that's how som of the famy of the miss in beid feel
authorities hav been un in their prelimin conclud that ter doe not appear to be behind the plane's disappearance
but no on can rul it out
i cannot confirm wheth ther is no hijack malays transport min hishammuddin bin hussein said at a new conf friday
like i said from the start and i've been very consist we'r look at al possibilities
a the day pass with no sight of wreck in the oc a the tak shap is that the plan might hav been land somewh eith by hijack or by the pilots
one of the clu that has comply the search is evid that the miss plan might hav switch cours drast aft it transpond stop send signals
if the plan did indee turn westward it would hav had enough fuel to hav mad it to ind or pak cnn law enforc analyst tom fuent said
it had enough fuel to do that fuent said
so what that say is somebody was fly that plan in that direct on purpose
whether it'd be a hijack or the pilot themselv someon was in control of that plan whil it stay in the air and kept flying
james kallstrom a form fbi assist direct said it's poss the plan could hav land though he ad that mor inform is nee to reach a definit conclusion
he refer to the vast search area
you draw that arc and you look at country lik pak you know and you get into yo superm novel and you see the plan land somewh and peopl repurpos it for som dastard dee down the road he told cnn's jak tapper
i mean that's not beyond the realm of realism
i mean that could happen
ev so he acknowledg the difficul of reach firm conclud with scraps of inform that sometim conflict
we're get so much conflict dat he said
you veer on way then you veer the oth way
the investig nee som definit correct data
john nant avy analyst for abc world new told cnn's erin burnet that any the must be tak with a hug grain of salt until wreck is found or someon claim that they hav hostages
i mean that's a far-out situ that act we would hop for he said
is ther stil hop that the passeng may be al somewhere
you know it's possible
it's not prob but again thi whol thing isnt prob nant said
this is what the lack of answ has op up an endless stream of poss that cannot be rul out no mat how unlik they sound
we're going to deal without the aly of course
well discount that commerc airlin capt
les abend told cnn's don lemon
he's skept about the that a 650000-pound plan somehow was spirit away to a hid location
where ar you going to hid thi thing and how ar you going to get conspir to get on board thi airpl command it and bring it to som remot place
abend asked
somebody's going to know about it
the ide that the plan was hijack or command to a runway somewh strikes him as far-fetched he said
this bord on a conspir the cnn intellig and sec analyst robert baer said of the poss that the plan land somewh to be us lat for nef purposes
but for every expert who feel thi way anoth see anoth possibility
billie vint a form faa sec direct said he think it is unlik that the plan crashed
it's improb that the plan flew for so many hour and then fel into the oc he said
that just doesnt mak sens which bring us around to the point that the poss and perhap ev the prob is that the airpl was hijack and command vint said
but then you hav to ask yourself to what purpose
th uncertainty provid thi mom wher off say ther is no sign of ter or hijack yet somehow it remain the most hop outcom for some
