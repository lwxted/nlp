brazil 3 lesson dem must learn from florid loss
editor's not donn brazil a cnn contribut and a democr strategist is vic chairwom for vot reg and particip at the democr nat committee
sh is a nat synd column an adjunct profess at georgetown univers and auth of cook with greas stir the pot in america
she was man for the gore-lieberman presid campaign in 2000
cnn there's no quest about it i hat to lose
on tuesday alex sink a gre democr run in a spec congress elect in florid lost
when a campaign doesnt go my way i alway tak a step back look at the fact and try to fig out what we could learn from that experience
and we definit learn som lesson from the florid spec election
first off let's put thi in perspective
republicans held thi congress district for six decades
in the past decad congressm bil young won his seat by anywh from 15 to 38
public pol in the run-up to elect day show that the elect was going to skew toward republ by around 10
the act republ margin of victory
about 2
i dont lik los any rac but let's not overst what thi was
we saw a republ win in a district that is tradit held by republ by a sign low margin than in the past 60 years
so what did we learn
there's the republ dogm bought by beltway pundit and som in the mainstream med that it was a referend on obamacare
th ap to rep work so they say
but as a gre am ont sang it aint necess so
according to david weigel at slat both david jol the republ and sink the democr reject the nat nar that the rac was a clear referend on obamacare
by a strong maj independ sid with the democr who was commit to fix and improv obamac ov the republ who want to rep it
th wasnt enough to chang the adv republ held going into elect day but we cam real close
how about money
yes republ pump money into thi race
republican spec interest group ar stil commit to throwing money behind any candid run with an r as a suffix
in thi rac outsid republ group dump in 5 mil to squeak out a win in a district they carry by 15 in 2012
money might hav been a fact but third party group align with democr also pour in money to help get out the vote
so democr cant entir say we lost becaus we wer outspent
wh then was it about
wh ar the real lessons
i think ther ar three the mess boot on the ground and mot the base
1
dont be afraid the republ mess was as is so oft be afraid
republicans accus democr of 716 bil in medic cuts
th was the sam them as progress act dav johnson point out that shift the 2010 elect to republ and it help again
it's iron of cours becaus democr want to fix healthc mak it bet and mor affordable
it's iron becaus by a strong maj independ sid with the democr who was commit to fix and improv obamac ov the republ who want to rep it
it's iron becaus from the start democr introduc push for defend and protect medicare
but the be afraid mess work wel for republ in part becaus the democr dont count it
dont be afraid is just not that good of a message
2
hit the ground the second thing we learn not surpr is that democr cannot win without a good ground gam and turnout stil matters
let' fac it mor republ vot fil and submit abs ballot than democr and mor turn out on elect day
as johnson point out 58 in precinct mit romney won in 2012 and 485 in precinct obam won
about 49000 few peopl vot in thi elect than in the 2010 gen midterm elect down 21 and 158500 few than in the 2012 presid elect down 46
we saw yet again that when few peopl particip in the process when few peopl vot republ win
democrats believ that when mor peopl vot it's not just good for our party it's good for democracy
3
it's al about the bas the third lesson is democr must mot the bas and not rely in tradit method to reach voters
in thi week's elect turnout was low than it was in the 2010 midterm elect and much low than it was in the 2012 presid race
low turnout in off-year rac is alway a challeng for democrats
many of our vot requir inform and must be contact way ahead of elect day and remind of what's at stake
yes a littl red meat help becaus thes vot tend not to be as season when it com to know the issu lik rais the minim wag and cre good pay jobs
luckily wel hav anoth chant to win thi seat back in novemb and with mor peopl vot wel hav an ev bet shot at pick up the seat
while we learn import lesson that wil help us win in novemb we wont fret ov thi loss too much
after al the republ in charg of elect republ to congress said bef the elect spec elect ar too predict for eith sid going forward
that was tru bef elect day and it's tru today
