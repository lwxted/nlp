5 thing about black cult now
editor's not justin simy is a film produc and writerdirector
his feat direct debut dear whit peopl won an award at the 2014 sund film festival
simien's vir conceiv trail for the film spark a convers about what it mean to be defin as black in america
cnn there's a scen in my satir film dear whit peopl in which soc misfit lionel higgin is ask to writ a black cult piec by the edit of a camp newspap staff with most whit people
lionel acceiv the assign with som trepidation
despite the benefit of being black larg afro and al he feel underqual becaus he has yet to find a pocket of cult he ident with at the fict winchest university
lionel's dilemm is on many black am shar a deep desir to hav an id root in black cult coupl with the knowledg that what's seen as auth black in popul cult doesnt reflect our act experience
we'r left in a sort of no-man's land becaus we dont oft see ourselv reflect in mainstream cult nor in popul black culture
in mak the film and eng in deb about the stat of black film her ar fiv thing i've com to know about black cult now 1
there is a diff between black cult and black cult black cult san quot is the sum tot of cult contribut to the mainstream by the black subculture
it's a fluid and a multifacet oft contradict thing
meanwhile black cult is a lifestyl standard mad of assum about black id oft us success by market studio head fash brand and mus label to mak money
it can be the cool fact that mak kid lin up for hour to spend their last dim on brand new michael jord sneakers
or the thing that mak whit peopl cal me broth and blast 2 chainz when i hop in the car
it's what peopl assum about black peopl and how they should sound liv and act
black cult may hav been born in black commun or cre by black americans
but when appropry for commerc ther is a dang of mistak black cult for act cult experience
that's wher the myth begin and it can devalu real hum experiences

black cult oftentim employ but is not alway defin by act black peopl oft by the tim black cult is being us to sel a produc or ide it's already been reinterpret by whit people
this isnt necess malicy but it's someth to note
w ar oft told what being black is by peopl who arent
up and com black hip hop art ar mold to ap to the mass by whit label executives
television show with black charact might hav no black writ or directors
i'm remind of a tim in colleg when a whit room insist he was black than i was by show me he could success crip walk
it was a feat i could not do nor car to match
but in that mom i was mad to wond if i was indee black enough despit being the on act black person present
in that mom i felt aly by a cult i had a nee to be root in
the black expery can sometim be so concret defin in the mainstream that it feel suffocating
the real of being black is much mor nuant and fluid

black cult is multicult black cult draw from a vary of influ born both in and outsid black communities
janelle monae's alb elect lady demonst thi it is a bril amalgam of art ref as disp as motown and fritz lang's metropolis
being black in americ involv a process of mov through and adopt from many diff cultures
to defin what's auth black is virt imposs as ther ar as many way to be black as ther ar black people

black cult is not propriet to black peopl many observ had a tough tim when rap macklem  ryan lew won the grammy for best rap alb ov kendrick lamar
there is simil discont ov the lack of black art being recogn or rot on radio in categ ont own by black mus lik rb or hip hop
but thi is not new
once commun of black art bir someth to the mass cult in many way it is no long ours
for every dizzy gillespy ther is a dav brubeck
it can be a tough pil to swallow
particularly when a cult we feel own ov reach new height of success in mor mainstream ie
whiter hands
there is someth unsettl about the fact that black art doing thing assocy with black cult rap twerk doesnt seem to capt the mainstream's at as pot as when whit art do it
see miley cyrus
personally i hap to enjoy both kendrick lam and macklem brubeck and gillespy and ev a coupl of hal  oat jam from tim to time
but i dont defin my black expery in someth as transy as mus or fashion
i get much mor infury when pres with an overt defin and limit depict of what being black represents
like being told i talk whit in school
or mcribs commercials
or mor egregy see whit kid in colleg dress as black stereotyp and post pict of it on facebook on a day meant to hon a civil right icon

black cult is a start point cult of any kind can be ground and comfort cre a hom for nour and rul for understand ourselves
but at a certain point a cult id too tight defin keep us from growing
i'm ground in but not limit by my blackness
when i beg try to get my film mad the confin of black cult seem to suggest that if a black movy wasnt broad com a hist ep tragedy or a street story ther would be no audy for it
but i mad it anyway
after mil of youtub view for the trail and sev sold-out screenings at sund my quirky rumin on rac and id has been warm receiv by audy and crit of al races
and that is real the genes of any cult ultim it's cre by individ and commun with the cour to do someth diff and unexpected
like be themselv
