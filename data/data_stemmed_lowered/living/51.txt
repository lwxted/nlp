on march 5 2013 i becam mol liam's mom
and sint then i've been wing thi whol mom thing
this is my decl of imperfect my truth confess that som may cal self i lov my son but i am mor than a mom
i alway want to be a parent
a lot of littl kid dream about what they want to be when they grow up
as a child my answ was alway the sam a mommy
even as i went on to colleg and a car i stil knew i want to be a mom
i knew my lif wouldnt be complet without it it was a mat of when not if
but bef i had a baby i was a colleg athlete
i travel to europ and sou afric with my colleg choir
i earn my master's degree
my husband and i got part as extra in a zomby film we wer zomby and it was awesome
now that i hav liam i stil hav my own interest my own thought and my own desir that hav noth to do with him
i crav person achiev phys profess and creatively
i lov to writ to bik and want to travel to austral to visit my pen pal of 15 years
there ar thing i want to do with my lif that hav noth to do with my sweet baby boy
and ev though liam is the most import thing to me in thi entir world ther ar mom when i'm real eng in my work or hav an amaz swe going at the gym when i forget about him complet along with everyth els going on in the world
recently i had a real i'm not fee my pass in life
a mon bef i turn 30 i was happy with my job and my famy but i just felt lik ther is mor i want to do with my life
i post thi stat to my facebook pag gen i'm ok with my life
but then sometim i just feel so mediocr - i want to do someth great
something big
someth bold
am i wast my existence
what to do what to do deepthoughtfortheday
i was surpr by the com being a mom is the greatest thing you can do
you wil alway be a mom
be the best mom you can be the rest wil fal into place
when i typ out that stat moth and my son wer not ev on my mind
i was think of myself my accompl my goal my dreams
i was surpr too with how thos respons mad me feel
i felt asham and wond what if being a mom is not enough for me
what would my friend oth moth think of me if i publ decl that i want mor out of lif than being a mom
i felt angry becaus for the first tim in my lif i felt my id was being reduc to on on aspect of who i am a mom
i wond how the respons to my post would hav been diff had i post that stat two year ago bef i was ev pregn or plan a family
i'd got a glimps of thes react whil i was pregn but at that mom it hit me hard
maybe i was nav but it hadnt occur to me that the way peopl saw me had changed
why did it feel lik socy somehow saw me diff the mom my son was born
wh i annount liam's bir on facebook did i go into som kind of tim warp and land in a categ label mom and ceas to ex as molly
would i alway be mol liam's mom
is ther stil room for plain old molly
then it dawn on me i should not feel guil for want mor satisfact from my lif beyond being a mom
why did i feel guilty
i think it com down to socy the med and the be the best mom that you can be
messages we receiv daily
it's lik peopl alway expect a mom to say someth about her child to be the tig mom the fit mom the work mom
i person think it's healthy to hav a solid id beyond being a mother
i can maintain my me-ness and stil be a gre moth to my littl liam
i know i'm not the on par moth or fath --who feel thi way
motherhood has chang som thing about me
i'v stop try to climb high simply for the sak of car advancement
and being a mom has mad me mor confid about put myself out ther and say how i feel
that in itself is quit empowering
my son is the most import person in my entir life
i do and wil alway lov him dearly
wanting to maintain my own id to be mol who lov her son and herself doesnt chang that
did peopl see you diff aft you becam a parent
