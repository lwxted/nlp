cnn when high schoolers tour the world's largest nuclear research facil from their desk or teach hav a chant to see the classroom through stud ey that's the pow of googl glass
but ev as google's much buzzed-about wear comput mak it way into the hand of technophil law enforc and firefight it might be a whil bef it com to a school near you
slowly googl glass is start to turn up in schools
a hand of educ ar bet test in google's glass expl program

they us glass to teach lesson from their perspect to shar with oth or for their own reference
they'r prop the glass on stud and us the foot and im from young peopl to understand what they see and how they learn
ev with limit apply and funct in thes ear vert of googl glass som teach and technolog enthusiast see hug potential
the poss ar endless as mor apply ar develop for the dev and as glass get into the hand of mor teach and stud said kathy schrock a form libr and technolog consult who serv on the board of intern socy for technolog in education
having a singl pair of googl glass in the classroom remind me of the day of the one-computer classroom
everyone had to wait for a turn to us the dev schrock a googl cert teach said in an e-mail
i think ont we see a k-12 school pilot with a classroom set of glass ther wil be many mor pract and cre us showcased
the virt field trip is oft tout as a us for glass and ther ar ap in develop expect to display inform about loc the glass wear sees
google sent onlin educ andrew vand heuvel to switzerland in 2013 so he could lead stud on a virt tour of the larg hadron collid at the europ org for nuclear research known as cern
through a googl hangout stud from sou christian high school in michig watch vand heuvel walk through the world's largest and most pow partic accel tak their quest and point out features
even mor common educ broadcast from insid the classroom lead sci lab group discuss or ev perform surgery for remot audiences
they show it in real tim through googl hangout and as video shar lat through youtub person blog and oth form of soc media
after his field trip vand heuvel continu us glass by mak a sery of instruct sci and math video cal stembites
when a new jersey high school stud had to miss school for med reason chem teach marc seigel ask the student's friend to wear glass dur sci lab and broadcast them to her in a googl hangout
an onlin group for glass expl in educ let us shar simil story and pos quest to the group of 612 members
but googl glass in every classroom could be a long way off
there's a long list of reason why the most intrigu dev in tech just isnt ready for school glass is expect to be mor wid avail toward the end of 2014 but the 1500 pric tag is a sign barry for schools and teachers
so far there's no educ discount teach said and googl hasnt annount plan to partn with educ institutions
it short battery lif nee to be resolv bef broad impl is poss teach said and glass is mir in priv concern espec when childr ar involved
to me the greatest valu of glass so far isnt what it's abl to do but the convers being had nat about how we interact with technolog and how we want it to be part of socy said vand heuvel who teach onlin math and sci classes
vanden heuvel view glass as anoth tool in his ars but it's not necess the best for every situ he said
i think the 1500 would be bet spent on three chromebooks he said
still ear adopt in educ ar look for way to mak it work
margaret pow low school technolog coordin at the episcop academy in newtown squ pennsylvan has been docu her expery us glass in class on on her blog 365 day of glass

powers said she can fin see the classroom through the ey of her stud who rang from pre-k to second grade
it show which detail catch their at and sometim rev simpl problem lik when pow real she was post som inform too high for her young stud to see
it has been real interest to try it becaus their perspect is so un and diff from our which is why i think glass has a lot of pot with thes ag rang she said
to get just a few mom to see how they learn to do a math problem or to get a sens of their vant point is so gre for teachers
