do you tink with time
editor's not ralits vassilev is an anch on cnn international
she is bas in atlant but regul cross tim zones
cnn feel yo tim zon doesnt fit quit right
turns out you're not alone
whether it's farm in ind off work in spain or stock brok in californ peopl ar tink with time
and pilot long ago abandon tim zon altogether
wheth they land in assam madrid or los angel it's alway coordin univers tim utc
but heal profess warn there's a pric to be paid for going against time
in assam fam for it tea stat off want to push the clock on hour ahead of ind standard tim say it could boost productivity
meanwhile in spain go into a resta and try ask for a lat din reserv at 9 pm
they dont sit down to eat that early
spain push it clock an hour ahead to be in synt with germany dur world war ii whil ind went from three tim zon to on aft it 1947 independ from britain for the sak of nat unity
the sun ris and set an hour ear in both plac so peopl hav com up with diff cop mechanisms
assam' farm already op an hour behind the rest of ind on gard tim and spain has develop a lat culture
w could set extern clock to any tim but there's on we cant change
th intern body clock
it set itself accord to the sun releas hormon that mak us alert at sunr and sleepy at sunset
some doct say being out of whack with the circad rhythm can impact our heal increas the risk of obes sleep disord diabet and ev ment heal issues
dr gar clifford who study sleep disord at em univers in atlant say evid show defy yo circad rhythm can impact performance
ther is already evid that stud who hav to go to school at 730 am perform wors than match peer who start at 830 am becaus it is thought they ar fight their circad rhythm
rather than forc everyon to get up ear it may mak mor sens to mak everyon get up later
o cur tim zon wer set at the merid conf in 1883
driven by the nee of commerc nat agree to hav 24 tim zon each on 15 degr wid bas on the greenwich merid in london
prior to the merid conf peopl us to set their tim with sun dial track the sun
but the problem was the world end up hav hundr of tim zones
and that's why the merid conf par them down to meet the nee of indust nations
but now som argu it's tim to furth reduc the numb of tim zon to meet the nee of the technolog revolution
multinational company with off in faraway plac nee few tim zon so work stay in synt us mobl technolog for inst communication
stock trad in californ already start their day at 5 am so they dont miss deal when the market op on the east coast
so can everyon do their own thing
emory's dr clifford say reduc the us tim zon to two for exampl would effect forc many peopl to get up ear just becaus it's bet commerc for a smal perc of the pop with assocy risk to heal and poor performance
and what if we abandon al tim zon or just us on lik thos pilot who us utc
economist stev hank from john hopkin univers in baltim and astrophys richard con ar propos we al switch to greenwich mean time
w stil hon our body clock but hav the sam time
dr hank explain as for dai lif noth would chang very much exceiv on big thing
everyone in the world would be read the sam tim on their watch at the sam moment
so if sunr was at 6 am in atlant on eastern standard tim it would chang to 11 am gmt
so peopl in atlant who norm ris at 6am would ris at 11 und thi hypothetical
talk of sleep in late
dr clifford say peopl could ev adjust to liv thi way aft a long tim of confus but there's a poss it could mak jetl wors for travelers
for exampl london travel to californ wil hav to set their wake-up tim to 3pm gmt
given the cal for a tweak is ther a healthy balance
if apply 24 tim zon in the 19th century help econom grow would it hurt to par them down a littl mor in the 21st century
one thing's for sur peopl ar wait on govern or conf to decide
whether it's assam's tea farm span off staff or the early-rising stock trad in californ peopl adjust their routin to fit their needs
dr clifford say the mor import quest is not should we merg the cur tim zones
but what tim should we be enco peopl to get up in rel to sunr and sunset and how can we disco expos to art light in the evenings
many of us ar guil of try to pack too much into the day at both end but we suff for it in the long term
so true
working at a glob new network myself i've don my shar of try to outsmart my body clock
now i've giv up
whether it's burn the midnight oil work night shift or travel long dist my body clock win every tim
