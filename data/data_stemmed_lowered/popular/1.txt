pilot whoev chang flight path was an expert
editor's not robert goy is the editor-in-chief of fly magazin and a commerc jet rat pilot
cnn investig now say that accord to autom electron connect attempt by the ac dat report system of malays flight 370 the airpl flew far to the west in an entir diff direct than it should hav been head as per it origin flight-planned rout which was to the north
the 90-degree turn to the west might hav been pur random if ent by a nonpilot or inexpert pilot who knew simply how to turn a singl knob cal the head bug that could command the autopilot to mak a turn to a new head or direction
there is strong evid that thi is not what happened
investigators now believ accord to new report that aft it transpond and ac radio wer turn off turn wer in at gps waypoints
these waypoint ar ess virt checkpoint in the sky defin mark chart by airspac reg that cre pathway in the air that airpl follow to keep saf sep from each other
the waypoint ar defin by an exact latitud and longitud and can be loc by a numb of the airplane's vary navig includ gps
if the report of the flight path ar tru it is not a rout that could hap by accident
there ar two way the 777-200 could hav flown on thi path
after pass on waypoint it could hav been direct to fly to the next waypoint by a pilot turn the head knob toward that exact plac a process that would requir som pilot expertise
this would be very unus and a nov or pilot without much fly expery on thi plan would not know to mak thes kind of input or hav any conceiv reason to do so
the almost certain expl would be that thes waypoint wer program into the flight man system of the 777-200 a task that would hav been beyond the abl of anyon but a profess pilot
the autopilot follow the cours put into the flight man system by the pilots
that is when the autopilot is not being man control instead
the man control part is easy
you turn a knob and the airpl goe wher you ask it to
the flight man system part is very complicated
i am a commerc pilot and i hav don som train on the boe 777
even aft a few hour of profess instruct i would hav been un to program the flight man system to command the autopilot to fly the flight plan that flight 370 report flew
this leav us with on of two poss conclusions
either the flight was command by a group with at least on profess train pilot among them or on of the pilot in control program the new off-route flight plan into the flight man system
the lat would be far mor likely
when ter hijack the airpl that wer flown into the world trad cent tow and the pentagon they flew the airpl by hand and thos hijack had train for month with that exact miss in mind
in the cas of flight 370 it would almost certain hav remain on autopilot which would hav duty follow the flight plan in the flight man system
that flight plan was quit poss ent for som mystery reason by a train pilot
