blood test predict alzheimer's
cnn in a first-of-its-kind study research hav develop a blood test for alzheimer's diseas that predict with aston acc wheth a healthy person wil develop the disease
though much work stil nee to be don it is hop the test wil someday be avail in doct off sint the on method for predict alzheimer's right now such as pet scan and spin tap ar expend impract oft unrely and sometim risky
this is a pot game-changer said dr howard federoff seny auth of the report and a neurolog at georgetown univers med center
my level of enthusiasm is very high
the study was publ in nat medicine
w wer surpr in the begin the research knew they want to find a blood test to detect alzheimer's but didnt know what spec to look for
should they examin paty dna
their rna
or should they look for the byproduc of dna and rna such as fat and proteins
they decid to start with fat sint it was the easiest and least expensive
they drew blood from hundr of healthy peopl ov ag 70 liv near rochest new york and irvin california
five year lat 28 of the seny had develop alzheimer's diseas or the mild cognit problem that us prec it
scouring mor than 100 fat or lipid for what might set thi group apart they found that thes 28 seny had low level of 10 particul lipid comp with healthy seniors
to confirm their find the research then look at the blood of 54 oth paty who had alzheimer's or mild cognit impairment
this group also had low level of the lipids
overall the blood test predict who would get alzheimer's or mild cognit impair with ov 90 accuracy
we wer surpr said mark mapston a neuropsycholog at the univers of rochest med cent and lead auth of the study
but it turn out that it appear we wer look in the right place
alzheimer's risk bef symptom do you want to know
the holy grail the beauty of thi test mapston say is that it caught alzheimer's bef the paty ev had symptom suggest that the diseas process begin long bef people's mem start failing
he say that perhap the lipid level start decreas at the sam tim as brain cel start dying
he and his team plan to try out thi test in peopl in their 40s and 50s
if that work he say that would be the holy grail becaus then research could try expery drug and tre in a group that's almost sur to get the disease
that would spee research along immensely
plus peopl could get a head up that they wer prob destin to get alzheimer's
although som peopl might not want to know that they're destin for a horr diseas oth might be grat for the warning
federoff said he would want to know wheth he was on his way to get the diseas ev though there's noth he could do about it
he might want to tak a famy trip he'd been think about or might want to appoint a success at work
i would mak sur that thing that ar import to me get don he said
but federoff ad oth might not want to know they wer about to get a devast diseas they wer powerless to stop
i think it's a very person decid federoff said
it would hav to be thought through on multipl dimensions
patient and their famy would hav to be counseled
next step oth research team ar look at oth poss test for alzheimer's
the nee for a screening test of som kind for alzheimer's has nev been gre a report releas last week say the diseas claim the liv of perhap a half a mil am mak it near as dead as heart diseas and cancer
if any of thes test work out and that's stil an if it would tak year to mak it to doct off sint the test would nee to be valid by oth lab and with larg group of people
th test develop by the georgetown and rochest research for exampl was us main in whit peopl and it might not work as wel with oth groups
heather snyd a spokeswom for the alzheimer's assocy said the study was wel don but much work is stil needed
it's an interest paper
it's an intrigu study
but it is very prelimin she said
overwhelming burd cost of alzheimer's to tripl report say
