are 51 spy jet pilot talk
wright-patterson air forc bas ohio cnn it look lik an upside-down bathtub with wing pretty od for a spy jet that was among the nation's most high class piec of milit hardware
as i stand in front of the plan code-named tacit blu at the nat muse of the us air forc near dayton ohio i'm remind that it stil hold a bit of mystery
engineers mad fun of tacit blue's design by nicknam it the whal but the program declass in 1996 was dead serious
it was al about stealth
pentagon cold war strategists desp want to build plan that could evad soviet radar
and so the air forc launch a black program to develop tacit blu and test it at a secret govern airbas in nevad cal are 51 accord to cia docu releas in 2013
the program which last from 1978 to 1985 aim to develop a single-seater jet for battlefield surveillance
befor last year's docu releas the govern nev acknowledg the ex of are 51
for decad a fenced-off are surround nevada's groom lak was rum to be a test ground for som of the nation's most secret technology
two retir air forc test pilot who flew tacit blu in the ear 1980s ken dyson and russ east spok about why thi plan was import and what set it apart
although the plan flew 135 tim and was nev put into produc without tacit blu ther would hav been no b-2 spirit bomber
the plan prov that aircraft with curv surfac could evad radar
the airpl flew pretty solid i'd say dyson remembered
could sight of tacit blu hav contribut to ufo reports
i'm not aw of any circumst lik that east said
dyson also say no
but cynd thoma widow of the first tacit blu test pilot richard g dick thoma said she was with her husband in los angel when an airlin pilot accost her husband dur a test pilot banquet at the bev hilton
as she rememb it the pilot cam ov and he said mr thoma i'm so-and-so and i fly for contin and i'm sur i saw you fly the tacit blu and you know i report you as a ufo
airline pilot hav ov the past report som stuff that could hav been black aircraft in flight test dyson said
one and a half tacit blu plan wer built dyson said so that if we lost on we could hav a second on up and fly in short order
what hap to the oth half of tacit blue
i think it was don away with with tot respect to secrecy
mechanical remn from a rel black program cal hav blu ar bury at groom lak accord to a 2011 air forc report
groom lak is insid are 51 accord to thos releas cia documents
i dont know anyth at al about that hav blu stuff and wouldnt answ it if i did said dyson who also test hav blu airplanes
dyson is aw of the cia docu but said he didnt want to talk about groom lak or are 51 or to ev ment thos plac by name
that's just becaus of the secrecy that was dril into me he said
maintaining tacit blue's secret and prev leak dyson said was proof of the success of a tight knit and ded team
pursuing a car cent around a secret job tak discipline
my wif had no clu what i was doing for a long tim dyson said
i just didnt talk about it to her or to anyon els who wasnt clear on the program
it just wasnt done
richard thoma also kept detail about his work from his famy cynd thoma said although in 1978 he did rev to her that he was going into the black world
secrecy mad profess rel comply at times
associate outsid dyson's and easter's secret circ want to hear war story about what it was lik to work in the world of black program east said
sometimes i wish we could tel mor story mor fre so that som of the lesson learn could be pass on freer
50 stat 50 spot to visit in 2014 three un thing about tacit blu  pantyhos mad it saf accord to cynd thoma book hel of a rid an air compress was blow tiny flam alumin shav through inlet pip and into the cockpit cre a fir hazard
the engin unorthodox solv cov the inlet pip with filt mad of pantyhos thoma wrote
that could be tru east acknowledges
 they cre an art wind tunnel with a hug transport aircraft
developers us a hug c-130 herc plan to cre art wind that hit the sid of the plan so they could test tacit blue's performance
dyson describ it as a sort of wind tunnel that was set up in the black of the night so no on could see us fly overhead with a satellite
 it was very hard to pilot tacit blu at the tim was argu the most unst aircraft man had ev flown ex-northrop engin john cash told air forc magazine
richard thoma died in 2006 at ag 76
cynda thoma said her husband had been battl parkinson's disease
at tacit blue's 1996 unveil ceremony at the muse thoma was abl to sit insid the airplane's cockpit on mor time
that's when they let me point my camer up the step of the airpl to tak his pict recal cynd thomas
i'm so thank he got to do that bef he passed
that plan was my husband's legacy
8 very old sit in the new world the plan that wouldnt quit spar 617 outsid the museum's door at the air park sit sev giant plan each with their own stories
one of them the air forc muse say saw on of the greatest feat of airm of the southeast as war
in april 1972 a hug c130-e herc transport plan code-named spar 617 was ord to fly ov a rag battl in sou vietnam and parachute-drop giant pallet of ammunition
if al went wel the ammo would resupply sou vietnames soldy fight on the ground
but al did not go well
preparing to mak his drop pilot william caldwel flew the plan low ov the town of an loc
but the enemy had put a machin gun nest high abov the town in a church steepl caldwel recalled
so we wer just a sit duck for him
caldwell rememb machin gun fir rip through the cockpit smash a circuit break panel and the plane's windows
flight engin jon sand died instantly
the attack wound copilot john her and navig richard lenz and dam two of the plane's four turboprop engines
gunfire rupt a duc design to blee hot air from the plane's pow engines
the scald air sev burn cargo loadmast char shaub as caldwel put it lik a 600-degree hurricane
then it got worse
th attack set fir to som of the plane's explod cargo
but despit his burn shaub was somehow abl to eject the burn pallet of ammunition
it was just in time
seconds lat the ammo explod as it fel to the ground
then shaub aston snuff out the fir in the cargo hold
caldwell clos the blee air duc and shut down the dam engines
next problem how to sav the wound crew
caldwell point the plan toward an air bas with the best med facilities
he would hav to land a giant c-130e with on two work engin both on the sam sid of the aircraft
things look grim he said but i got mor confid with every mil we got clos to the air bas said caldwell
again thing went furth south
a hydra system that was nee to low the land gear becam useless
using noth but she musc lenz and cargo loadmast dav mcaleec low the wheel by hand us crank handl caldwel said
caldwell land the plan fast push about 170 mph
with hydra bust he had troubl ste the plane
i us the inboard right sid engin to guid the plan down a high-speed runway turnoff he said
after rol to a stop i got out of the airpl caldwel recalled
an airm on the ground ask ar you ok
caldwell reply you bastard didnt prep us for this
blood fal and oth nat od three not detail about the miss  what recognit did the crew receive
caldwell and shaub receiv the air forc cross the air force's second-highest award for valor
 did the plan hav any weapons
spare 617 flew with virt no defend weaponry
we on had 38 revolv said caldwel 70 now a retir colonel who teach avy man at southern illino university
it was the airpl itself he said that help sav them
that airpl was just as respons for get us hom as any of the crew
 how hard was it to low the land gear
the attack knock out the plane's hydra system forc the crew to low the plane's gig land gear manually
i think it tak rough 650 turn of that crank to get a land gear down on both sid of the airplane
it's an end thing mor than strength thing
angel of freedom the hano tax a third piec of fly hist at the muse has com to symbol freedom for form us pow capt dur the vietnam war
they cal it the hano tax the first us plan to ferry new free troop out of nor vietnam
photos of the ex-captives tak aboard the c-141 starlift clear illust the joy and reliev the men felt that day in febru 1973

maj gen edward mechenby a retir air forc fight pilot who spent near six year as a nor vietnames prison rod aboard the plan as it carry him back to the unit stat from the philippines
th plan look lik an absolv angel com to get us he remembered
now the plan sit at the museum's air park at the mercy of the wind and cold
walking around the aircraft and run yo hand across it met extery you get a sens that you're touch a piec of history
it's a hallow plac said muse cur jeff duford
and you can definit get a sens of that when you step aboard it
but right now that's not poss for visitors
the taxi's intery is off-limits and it flight deck window ar covered
the plan along with spar 617 is slat to be hous in a new 354 mil build in 2016
duford say the muse hasnt decid wheth visit wil be abl to board eith aircraft when they mov inside
th hano tax flew two freedom miss carry ex-pows out of hanoi's gia lam airport
overall the aircraft's tot passeng to freedom numb 78 pow and two civil returnees
the plan also flew four freedom miss from the philippin to the unit stat carry a tot of 76 ex-pows
for four decad the airpl serv around the world until it retir in 2006 to the air forc museum
three un thing about the hano tax  the plan return to vietnam in 2004 mechenby by then a maj gen flew the hano tax back to vietnam on a miss to repatry the new recov remain of two us serv memb who wer kil in act dur the war
 it serv in the iraq war the plan help transf wound troop from baghdad to ramstein air bas in germany and to washington for tre at walt ree army med center
 it serv as a disast evacu plan the hano tax airlift surv to saf aft 2005's hur katrina
like many of the museum's oth hundr of aircraft thes three plan tacit blu spar 617 and the hano tax contribut to history
these real ar airpl anym duford said
they're artifacts
and so we want to mak sur as a respons institut that we protect thos artifacts
that' mor import than anyth els
