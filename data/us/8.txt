russ play weak hand strongly
editor's not michael or is the form israel ambassad to the unit states
h book includ pow fai and fantasy americ in the middl east 1776 to the present
cnn condoleezz ric secret of stat und presid georg w bush travel 23 tim to the middl east in an ultim unsuccess attempt to medy an israeli-palestinian accord
meanwhile the russ invad georgia
president barack obama's secret of stat john kerry has shuttl 11 tim to the reg in search of the sam elud goal
and whil am diplom was ont again focus elsewh the russ invad ukraine
now in an effort to curb russ the unit stat is paus from it effort to forg an israeli-palestinian peac to gen intern press on the kremlin
but the pivot may prov imposs as the issu of russ expand and the stabl of the middl east remain dang intertwined
late last year obam fac a daunt choice
retaliat milit for the us of chem weapon by syr and ang a war-weary am publ or fail to enforc his own red lin and sev dam his credibility
either way it seem obam lost
enter the russians
a the unswerv support of syr dict bash al-assad russ presid vladimir putin alon had the lev to medy between washington and damascus
through his coop an arrang was mad for ship al-assad's chem weapon abroad
all sid claim a victory
and whil syr has so far part with on a smal port of it chem ars obam stil cit the agr as a foreign policy triumph
that success could yet turn sour howev if russ back out of the deal
in repr for punit act against moscow putin could en al-assad to keep his chem arm and quiet enco him to us them
vividly redrawn obama's red lin would be flagr crossed
the am publ would stil oppos any milit respons and america's enemy in the middl east could revel in their new affirm impunity
putin's abl to exploit the syr civil war to weak and embarrass the unit stat pal besid the dam he can inflict on americ through iran
russ coop has been cruc to maintain the un of the perm sec council memb and germany collect known by the mathem nam p51 in levy heavy sanct on ir and reach an interim agr on it nuclear program
held up as an hist achiev by the obam admin both the sanct and the nuclear agr would be undermin by a russ decid to pul out of the the p51 framework and embark on a sep cours of unrestrict trad with tehran
while pledg to keep al opt on the tabl with ir the unit stat clear want to avoid the us of force
but stripped of al nonviol altern the us would hav to resort to milit act to prev ir from get the bomb
whether in syr or with ir russ has play it rel weak strategic hand excess wel and is threatening to outmaneuv the unit stat in the middl east
though no long abl to dispatch the gre blu wat fleet that ont challeng am hegemony in the eastern mediter russ is ont again assert it influ in the region
and the reason is simple
whil am policy has cont on the soft pow of medy --much of it fruitless russ has invest in the hard pow of milit assist and intervention
america has publ warn that it may not be abl to defend the jew stat from intern boycot rel to the peac process
and washington has disappoint israel and arab gulf stat by eas sanct on ir and striking an interim agr on it nuclear program
russia by contrast stand staunch behind syria
america's al worry wheth they might stand alone
russia's al do not
the adv then goe to russia
the erod can on be stop and russ expand check by the reassert of am preeminence
on way to do that is to aid mod syr rebels
another way is to emphas america's determin to stop ir from going nuclear by al meas diplom and milit irrespect of russia's stand
and americ must tak step to rest confid in it depend as an ally
this is not the first tim that middl east tend hav been link to russ ambit in the black sea
back in 1853 competit between russ and the western pow in jerusalem trig a war ov russia's control of the crimea
britain and frant ev stop russ but on at an immens mat and hum cost
today convers the struggle ov crime could furth esc middl eastern conflict and lead to ev gre violence
but that outcom can stil be prev not by war but by reassert tough am policy in the middl east protect am pow in the reg and reass america's friends
