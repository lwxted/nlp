x-rays show supernov secrets
cnn lab expl the latest innov around the world to showcas cutting-edge design and groundbreak research in sci and technology
cnn cassiope a was a star mor than eight tim the mass of our sun bef it explod in the cataclysm fiery dea astronom cal a supernova
and thank to nas spac telescop sci ar learn mor than ev about exact how it happened
the nust spac telescop array is the first to map the radioact mat from a supernov explosion
the result wer publ wednesday in the journ nature
until we had nust we couldnt see down to the cor of the explod bri grefenstet lead auth and research sci at the californ institut of technolog said at a new conf wednesday
nustar's observ of cassiope a show sci the loc and distribut of radioact titanium-44 an unst isotop with a half-life of about 60 years
the supernov explosion's light ar on ear about 350 year ago but ev today there's stil plenty of titanium-44 to be observed
each atom of titanium-44 decay to calc as wel as two partic of light at particul frequ that nust can detect
nustar which stand for nuclear spectroscop telescop array launch in jun 2012 and consist of an instru with two telescop that foc high energy x-ray light
there's cur no solid model for how the supernov explod process act work grefenstet said
scientists would lik to know mor espec becaus the compon of our planet cam from a supernov that blew up about 5 bil year ago
people should car about supernov explod becaus that's wher al the stuff that mak us com from grefenstet told cnn
all of the iron in yo blood and calc in yo bon and tee and gold in yo wed band that al com from the cent of a supernov explosion
all the world's gold cam from collid of dead star sci say the map of the radioact ash that nust study is akin to a fossil record grefenstet said
it is an imprint of what hap in the explod and it is help astronom rul out prevy idea about how star explode
so here's what sci think is hap at the cent of the supernov an intens amount of press build up
neutrinos tiny partic ar produc and heat up the gas in the center
what you get is just lik when you're boil wat on yo stov top you get hot bubbl at the bottom that try to ris up through the cold mat abov it and the whol thing start to slosh around grefenstet said
big bubbl form in thi process and the whol thing start to fal apart he said
it's lik blow the top off a press cook and the shock wav rip apart the star grefenstet said at the new conference
th nust observ suggest that thes larg bubbl ar pres at the cent of the star a phenomenon that had been thought about through comput model but nev observed
the new study find evid for the bubbl form in the first fract of a second of the explosion
it's lik you blink yo ey twic and the whol thing has explod and we'r see it three or four hundr year lat preserv in the radioact ash grefenstet said
researchers describ thi explod process as asymmet becaus accord to their model temp and dens must be diff around the explod in ord for the bubbl to escap and let the shock wav out
scientists ar ready to say definit that thi slosh model of supernov explod caus cassiope a to blow apart but the evid support that the grefenstet said
cassiopeia a a well-studied celest object is about 11000 light year away
that mean techn it explod mor than 11000 year ago but becaus of it dist from us we on could hav learn about it about 350 year ago
it's unlik that any earthl observ it back in the 17th century howev becaus of the amount of dust between our planet and the supernov explosion
there is a record of a new star chart by a brit astronom around the tim the supernova's light should hav reach us but it's controvers becaus that star is not in the plac in the sky wher cassiope a would hav been
the hubbl spac telescop has examin the supernova's opt light and the chandr x-ray observ look at it low-energy x-rays
the radioact ash is avail for the first tim to nust which can detect high-energy x-rays
nustar has also giv sci a new mystery to pond about supernovas
they expect the radioact titan map to match the map of iron becaus thos el ar thought to hav been cre in the sam plac of the explosion
instead their distribut ar very different
this may mean that that ther is mor iron that hasnt been seen yet or that ther is someth complet diff that gen elements
nustar is liv up to it nam way in two way robert kirshn an astronom at the harvard-smithsonian cent for astrophys who was not involv in the study said at the new conference
it's not just nuclear but it's new
cosmic wow a rar explod star
