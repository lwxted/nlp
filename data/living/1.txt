all of thos ar fact that go along with peopl hav bet lif evaluations
once thos fact wer stat remov the study found no diff in how satisfy the two group felt about their lives
stone said in an interview that simil in report happy among par and the child-free espec in develop country lik the unit stat can be chalk up to pri spec wheth a person choos to hav kids
read mom fin fear led to mor spank shout i choos an orang becaus i lik oranges
you choos an appl becaus you lik apples
there' no reason to think that yo expery should be any bet than min said stone
th orang is diff than the apples
having kid is diff than not hav kids
it doesnt mean that on is  intrins better
sarah maiz auth of the children's book on my way to bed and a mom of three in los angel agrees
it' lik ask who's happy peopl who lik pizz or peopl who lik chinese
sh said on facebook
now what i'd lik to know is who liv longer
 that you can measure
th princeton-stony brook study which involv an examin of a survey of 18 mil am includ par between the ag of 34 and 46 conduc by gallup from 2008 through 2012 did find on diff between par and the childless par tend to expery mor high and lows
they hav high highs
they hav mor joy in their liv but also they hav mor stress and neg emot as wel said stone
adina mcginley a mom of three who liv outsid new york city said watch childr grow is prob life's greatest joy
at the sam tim she said stress ov want yo kid to hav good liv can be tap into at any tim sometim to an aw degr and thi ad endless strain to marriage
that strain can lead par to feel less satisfy with their rel accord to anoth study thi on by the op univers in england
in that study which involv survey of mor than 5000 peopl in england and in the unit stat the auth found childless coupl wer happy with their rel and their partn than par wer and wer doing mor work on their rel than par couples
when ask who was the most import person in their liv moth said their childr and fath said their partn the study found
it may be dur thos mid-years when peopl ar par that ther is a shift away from the rel for wom as they foc mor on childr said dr jacqu gab on of the study's co-authors
read lady stop try to be perfect
gabb who is a seny lect in soc policy at the op univers said thi doesnt mean the rel ar not working
it just mean ther is a diff in emphas and prob part due to the tim pinch she added
there just isnt as much tim to devot to the relationship
jen boss a mom of two who blog at defin my happy said on facebook al too oft when coupl hav kid they begin to depriorit on another
that's the problem not the children
ironically accord to the op univers study moth wer sign happy with lif than any oth group includ childless wom a find gab say which can be explain by how moth said childr wer no
1 in their lives
if they're the happiest with lif but the least cont with the level of rel satisfact and least happy with partn and least happy with the amount of maint of the rel but they're happy with lif then there's got to be someth said gabb
what's a par or a nonp to mak of thi latest somewh conflict research
perhaps the most act find for our liv com from the op univers study apt titl end love
coupl rel in the 21st century
read doe dist real mak the heart grow fonder
the auth found that when ask what mak peopl feel most valu in their rel research particip said smal act of kindness
it' as littl as say i lov you said gabb
out of everyth in lif moth ident hav a cup of tea brought to them in bed as significant
in the us we might replac that cup of tea with a lat from starbuck but we al get the point
relationships benefit from thos everyday gestures
we nee to think diff about what constitut rel work and we nee to think about if it's thos everyday smal thing that ar import to peopl then let's think about what thos smal thing might be and start to be mor attun to what's going on in our own rel said gabb
i think il be pick up a lat on my way hom tonight
