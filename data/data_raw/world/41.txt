lying fac down in the back of their red pickup anders said he would clos his ey op them up on when his eyelid trembl in hop that what he was expery was on a bad dream
dont look at their fac i thought then theyl hav to kil you

i didnt know what els i was too in shock to think straight
andersen's co-worker who was also in the back of the truck with him laid stil lik a corpse
h pretend not to hear anders when he ask wheth the men wer going to kil them
i was start to break every part of me want to break down and cry
so i turn to pray and thought about my wife

a lot of am feel that when they visit mexico for vac or spend tim work ther they ar immun to the drug-related viol going on around them becaus they hav noth to do with it
the tru is that certain drug cartel and gang in mexico stop car long ago about stay away from am or innoc peopl in gen drug war analyst sylv longmir told cnn
the nam of the gam is to mak as much money as poss and non-latino am ar view as lucr kidnap-and-ransom target regardless of how much money they act hav in the bank back hom accord to longmir whos drug war blog is consid to provid som of the most comprehend analys of the sec situ in mexico
it's that perceiv among the cartel that might hav sav andersen's life
his kidnap decid to go forward with the ransom but for less than the 20000 origin demanded
while the risk is very high becaus us victim ar mor lik to trust and cal us law enforc ag lik the fbi som wont becaus they fear for their liv and thos of their famy memb longmir added
andersen's famy say it was work with the fbi on his case
but what ev help bring anders hom had noth to do with law enforc and had everyth to do with chance
an unlik al about halfway through his 36 hour in capt whil anders was being parad through the rur streets he met a young boy

for the first tim in capt i was being tre lik a hum he said
i start to trust him

andersen is convint that it was alberto's petit that kept him al whil ransom negoty wer ongoing
a smal ransom of 80000 peso or about 6000 was provid by andersen's boss at a remot loc in the city but the kidnap want more
andersen said he's convint they would hav kil him had he not off to get them his wife's near 7000 wed ring to mak up the rest of the latest ransom demands
