'the night i inv 3d printing'
frankfurt germany cnn cal him char charl chuck whatev you want
it's al okay with him
beaming a warm smil from benea his push-broom mustach the soft spok 74-year-old doesnt strike you as a pion innov the man respons for a breakthrough that's now driv forward the world of manufacturing
but chuck hul in thi kind of environ it's us chuck he say as he sit down with cnn in frankfurt germany is execut vic presid and chief technolog off of 3d system a company built on his cre the 3d printer
in 1983 hul was work for a smal busy that mad tough coat for tabl us ultraviolet lamps
when he suggest a new way to us the uv technolog to quick turn comput design into work prototyp hul was giv a littl lab to play around in dur his ev and weekends
hull expery for month on his own with a plastic-y gloop then on night someth emerg cnn when you beg what mat exact wer you using
hull the class of mat is cal photopolym and thes ar typ acrylic-based mat that would be liquid until they're hit with let's say an ultraviolet light
then they inst turn solid
so you hav a vat of thi liquid and a point of ultraviolet light and you turn it into a solid piec of plastic
and that's the bas method
that's the bas methodolog that's stereolithography
that's nev changed
who was the first person you show it to
er my wife
i got a good part and cal her up got her out of her pajama told her to com down to the lab and see this
what did she say
this had bet be good
laughs
 expl the 3d print revolv and then when did you see 3d print tak off
well it's real blossom just in the last few year in the sens of real rapid grow and recognition
there's a lot of thing that contribut to that i think a lot of the med apply catch peopl imagin certain the mak mov with low-cost machin get hobby interest in inv and build us 3d printing
how did the process develop into what it is today
one of the most sign chang is the bas acc you can achiev becaus the mat cur from a liquid to a solid they tend to shrink and they can distort
so as you build thes 3d part you get som inacc and warp-age
but that chem has been vast improv so there's almost no distort now
also the phys property init the mat wer real brittl they would break easily
nowadays you get real good tough plast materials
i hear the word democr us about 3d printing
is that import to you
the whol prem of thi technolog has been to fost cre and chang in produc design and manufact and so forth
at the individ level i think there's a gre kind of pent up nee we'v got into the comput ag and everyth is on a screen or remot we'v kind of miss the tang result
this is a mean to convert someth on the comput to real in a straightforward way
read 3-d print tri to find a hom could you hav imagin al this
laughs
 not at the consum level
i was alway think in term of design engin in term of their expend cad comput and so forth
what do you think the industry is wor now
i think wel in term of the tot good and serv it's about 3 bil an and it's act grow at a rapid rate
ar ther limit to what 3d print can do
there's limit to everything
so the kind of tradit limit of 3d print hav been mat property spee mak mil of things
but al the competit company ar just const push thos limit so if you're project the fut it look lik thes limit ar going to be beat down ov the next coupl of years
read victoria's secret model wear 3-d print wing what has surpr you most
to me som of the med applications
i didnt anticip that and as soon as i start work with som of the med im peopl it becam pretty clear that thi was going to work
but you know they told me i didnt tel them
what doe yo wif say
laughs she's prob mor enthusiast than i am so she's very excit about thi whol field
you mad yo discovery 30 year ago how hav you felt along thes long 30 years
i mean it's explod hasnt it
well you know i'm old enough that i should hav retir long ago but it's so interest that i dont
it's a real interest journey
