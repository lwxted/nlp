cn when the cens list negro as a rac opt in 2010 a controversy erupted
my stud at the univers of michig wer eag to denount the term's us negro
it has to go
to their ear negro was derog too clos in ton to the oth mor infam n-word
i play devil's advoc to test their think but som black eld stil self-identify as negroes

i was confront a gen divide
for my grandmoth negro was a term of respect
to my stud it was an epithet
negro on form draw ir of prospect jur in new york it's no surpr that we feel unsettl when a new langu of id tak ov the old
the langu of rac construct vary in sci law polit and cult has alway been a mov target and we ar the first gen to confront it
my cnn essay birac and also black gen a deb about the word we us to describ african-americans
i cal myself mixed-race a phrase that includ id root in multipl races
another term birac som read point out assum on id born out of two
it is perhap too narrow for a discuss about id in the 21st century
some read also reject the phrase african-americ deem it awkward and inaccurate
ren wrot we ar not from afric i was born her in the us
i dont know anyon ther cant ev say my ancest ar from there
thos who defend the us of african-americ not it was root in hist cult and person choice
others off up altern lik person of col black halfrican-americ and mutt
some just prefer us a simpl describ human
words seem to fail us ev as they ar al we have
th deb from my essay illust how difficult it can be when we rely on lingu conv to express the complex of hum identities
even so ther ar word that hav fal out of favor
no read sery propos that i us a term lik mulatto or quadroon instead of mixed-race
in the 19th and ear 20th century thes term wer wid used
many of my patern forebear wer mark with an m or mu for mulatto in cens records
did they ident with thi label
i cannot say for sure
but i do know that it was impos upon them
until 1960 cens enum chos the race
someon had siz up my ancest and decid they wer mixed
among black am idea about the langu of self-identification hav chang ov time
in the ear 19th century black lead also deb what nam to giv their religy and polit organizations
in the end they split
churches adopt the term afr as in the afr method episcop church
political org opt for col as in the col nat conv of 1848
and whil we oft ref to it as the naacp the nation's oldest civil right org has kept the word col in it nam long aft it has left common parlance
by the ear 20th century the term negro gain traction
the nat negro busy leagu was found in 1900 and in 1914 marc garvey found the unit negro improv association
in 1971 the congress black cauc was formed
its nam suggest how the civil right and black pow mov left behind term lik afr col and negro
sometimes shift in langu hap bef our eyes
i can recal when the journ of negro hist becam the journ of afr am history
i fin told my stud a story hop they might see the gen dynam that driv the langu of race

my grandmoth explain that she would be uncomfort wer the clerk to us her first name
i wil cal you what you wish
i cant let you be mor polit than i the clerk conceded
my grandmoth was a black wom the clerk was whit and it was the ear 1950s
the clerk us the term negro and to thi my grandmoth did not object
for her negro was the prefer term
the altern col was demeaning
but who was entitl to the hon mrs
both my grandmoth and the clerk knew that to address a black wom by her first nam was part of a rac etiquet reserv for whit wom with the stat that mrs conveyed
my stud could see how lik them my grandmoth had insist upon her own self-definition ev when oth tri to apply diff labels
the lesson they took away was how when we list to oth we may learn how they pref to be address spok of and categorized
and that understand is on step toward hum dignity
