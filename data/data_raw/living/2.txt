sh is a mom of two
read her oth column and follow her report at cnn par and on twitter
cnn my heart went out to barb dun the mom her 16-year-old son daniel answ my question
once he get his licens in jun would he text and drive
that's what i ask dur a kitch tabl convers in their roxbury new jersey home
as you can see in the video abov his answ was not the on his mom expected
i'm tak a deep brea said dun who rec purchas vis clip for daniel's friend who hav already got their licens that say stay alive
dont text and drive
i wouldnt ev mind if he said i'm at a red light and i pick up the phon for a minut to read someth and put it back down but that mov and text freak me out
it's not acceptable
daniel's mom might hav want to slam her head against the count but stil she told me she apprecy her son's cand and real in that mom how difficult it is to persuad teen who text near al day long not to do it whil behind the wheel
even a well-meaning teen is going to hav troubl say no when they get that buzz from an incom text or stat upd said david teat seny direct for the nat saf council
it's almost a pavlov response
read adult text mor than teen whil driv teat sad know al too wel what can go wrong with distract driving
ten year ago a 20-year-old wom who had been talk on a cel phon ran a red light and kil his then 12-year-old son joe
sinc then he's ded his lif to rais aw about the dang of talk on a cel phon whil behind the wheel
a new concern how to elimin driv whil texting
a technolog solv is incred important
we nee to tak the tempt away from peopl bef it hap said teater
a mov solv is at hand but par around the country might not real that ther is technolog already avail that can prev a teen from being abl to text whil behind the wheel
read young driv snap 'selfies at the wheel aeg mobl has cre softw that is instal direct onto a teen's smartphon tablet or oth handheld device
onc the teen start driv about 10 mil an hour the softw autom put the dev in saf mod which prev the teen from text e-mailing or brows the internet
the troubl said company presid and ceo paul zimmerm is that a lot of par dont know it exists
but he's try to chang that
iowa is mak the softw avail fre of charg it typ cost about 4 per mon to teen up to 17 as they apply to get their licens at the depart of mot vehic said zimmerman
since iow sign on many oth stat ar show interest he said
getting to teen as they get their licens or as they ar ins und their par plan is key say zimmerm who is a fath of two teens
let' fac it most teen wil not want thi produc volunt he said
it is up to the parent
and the impact could be wideranging
literally if our softw is on 10000 dev for mor than two year stat we wil hav sav a lif said zimmerman
people ar doing dang thing out ther anoth big challeng is convint teen and adult for that mat that talk on a phon is just as dang as driv und the influence
teater say us a cel phon with eith a handheld or hands-free dev whil driv result in a slow react tim than if you wer driv with a 08 blood alcohol level the leg limit
read fat wreck undersc risk for young driv car crash kil 100 peopl every day and ar the lead caus of accid death in the us say teater
meanwhile 90 of the crash he said ar caus by hum er includ driv try to do too many thing at once
do we want every singl person out on the roadway driv around upd facebook and clos busy deals
teater say whil the vast maj of peopl no long think it's respons to us a cel phon whil driv ther is stil work to be don convint peopl that talk on a phon hands-free can be just as dangerous
simply put our brain cannot handl two task at on mom the task of driv and the task of talk on the phone
you talk to any cognit psycholog they've known thi for decad that the hum brain can on foc on on attention-requiring task at any giv moment
the oth task is alway in the background said teater
read teen a driv danger
look to mom and dad he put it in term most driv can understand i ask them would you ev consid talk on the phon whil you're read a book
and they say wel of cours not i'd nev do that

so if you'd nev consid try to read a book whil talk on the phon why would you driv whil talk on the phone
so many of the kid wer cry and why would you ev drink alcohol and get behind the wheel
that's the quest lis brod ask teen as she visit schools a few year ago with her three kid includ 27-year-old kyle
