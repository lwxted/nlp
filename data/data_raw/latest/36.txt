tim berners-lee the web nee it freedom
cnn lab expl the latest innov around the world to showcas cutting-edge design and groundbreak research in sci and technology
cnn today is a landmark annivers for tim berners-lee
in march 1989 he wrot a propos to his employ at cern for a somewh abstract glob hypertext system he cal mesh
a year lat he re-named that system the world wid web
it caught on
a quart of a century lat berners-lee is lik a proud fath see his baby al grown up and mak it way in the world without him
i feel a certain amount of inventor's prid he tel cnn
my greatest prid has been the spirit of collab we'v had for the last 25 years
he' watch the web grow through a carefr child and turb adolesc reach the kind of ag when thing sud get mor sery and it's tim to mak som import decid about the future
at 25 it's mor lik a young adult he explains
suddenly it nee it independ young adult ar at the stag when they're look for freedom and in term of what they do they're assert their rights
now 25 year on web us ar real they nee hum right on the web  we nee independ of the web for democr we nee independ of the web to be abl to support the press we nee independ of the web in general
it's becom very import to sort out al that
rec year hav been mark by grow pains
revelation of mass surveil by the nsa and oth ag hav caus intern outrage
arguments ov net neut persist and copyright war pitch open-net act against mainstream cre industry hav grown bit with berners-lee himself crit at times
the stock and us of illicit mat has grown with the dark net
berners-lee is clear that our abl to speak and assocy fre is und threat
the widespread dat gath of the nsa rev a brok system he believ and he pra whistl blow lik edward snowd whos leak expos the excesses
when system break the whistl blow is the person who sav socy by point out someth that nobody els wil becaus it's illeg he says
one thing i'd lik to see built in the fut is an intern conv and intern respect for whistl blowers
read edward snowd i'd do it again if spy is on threat bern lee believ cens is another
he recal the situ in egypt wher the internet was cut off at the height of anti-government protest in janu 2011
for a lot of peopl that was the first tim they real you could turn it off and they ask themselv who could turn it off for me
h say ad that turn off the internet is mor or less a sign that the regim doe not trust it cit and that the regim is on the way out
 58 berners-lee is not tak a back seat
having inv the web ont he hop to re-invent it through the web we want in aim to cre a univers internet us bil of rights
key target of the manifesto includ spreading net access to the near two third of the world that stil doesnt hav it
establishing clear reg is also a pri as is the protect of person us information
read the ear web slow simpl and spars berners-lee stil enjoy enough pow ov his cre to mak big chang real through two auth he found and continu to lead
the world wid web consort wc3 determin standard for al web infrastruct back by the world's lead academ institut and softw developers
the web found man the spread and eth apply of the web bring press to bear on govern through in such as the web index which rank nat by internet access standards
the web we want campaign wil rely on mass mobl across industry nat and act body to success but berners-lee is confid of fost a spirit of cooperation
he has seen it bef and consid it the web's greatest accomplishment
it's real a story of collab peopl work painstak on get protocol right 
there's an intern spirit that ign bound he says
a for what the web wil look lik ov the next 25 year as it ent it middl ag bern lee see a smart web emerg with us empow by the hug amount of person inform collect as part of the web of dat inform that could help person our web experience
peopl ar worry about what oth peopl ar doing with their dat he say but they hav real what they can do with their own data
as we grow mor connect to and rely on the web so the pot for abus increases
how we us such a pow tool amount to a test of our specy say berners-lee but it's on he is confid we can pass together
