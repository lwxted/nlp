cn whil much of the world is focus on the russ incurs into the crim peninsul of ukrain anoth long-term mov may allow the form soviet navy to domin us interest to the nor the arctic
the rapid melt of the arct oc is quick cre a new vary of challeng that hav the pot to caus sign glob dam if they remain unaddressed
the obam administration's policy correct recogn that the unit stat has profound import econom and cult interest in the arct but regret rev very littl about what the fed govern wil be doing outsid of the sci field
while rec us policy eith dant around the cor issu or wors do not acknowledg that they ex the russ ar tak the lead on arct policy
after al the arct is in their backyard too
moreover russ as if to highlight the valu they plac on their navy and renaiss as a maritim nat took control of the strategic crim peninsul ass and sec warm wat russ navy access to the glob commons
in light of thes rec ev it would be wis for washington to sery consid the econom pot and sec vuln that ex on or near the us arct coastline
overwhelmingly the us arct policy deb echo past concern of the arct nat wildl refuge
consequently many in the policy commun ar push a heavy sci and no-development agend to preserv the pristin charact of the region
the rec issu depart of defens arct strategy is a cas in point it talk extend about the dod sci miss and us the term sustain develop and preserv of the unspoil are as import nat goals
but just say no ign the fact that the precy arct min and oil and gas resourc wil help ass the unit stat is abl ov tim to achiev and then maintain it energy independence
scienc is incred import as is saf and respons develop of the arct but our ag and sci nee to approach thes issu with a gre sens of urgency
arguabl the sci nee to be a compon of a detail nat act but that's on a fract of good us policy
us arct policy should priorit four thing on demonst lead in the arct and develop a strategy and policy to match
the us has no lead in the high nor and russ doe which is a gre concern for our allies
two invest in infrastruct navy and coast guard to support us sec and commerc interest in the arctic
the key her is to develop the policy that driv thos requir so we ar not lat to need
three demonst lead in the maritim domain worldwid and not ret as we ar doing by default in the arctic
four facilit and furth develop offsh nat resourc in the high northalask and the nat intern maritim and geopolit govern structures that wil underpin thos enterprises
washington in less than two year wil assum a lead rol when it becom chair for the arct council
unfortunately the dod policy and us navy arct roadmap 2014 do not artic what the us arct lead agend wil entail
the real is ign the issu and choos not to particip in the arct wil not mak the issu go away
yes budget ar challeng but the arct is no diff from any oth intern fronty or glob common wher the us has interests
we nee to protect it and demonst lead in the maritim domain not retreat
so too our policy mak nee to be look beyond our shor to moscow ottaw oslo copenh the arct council intern oil company and lloyd of london for help in solv thi govern challenge
th last thing that any of the arct stat can afford is to back into a russian-generated cris with no resourc or a plan
the tim is now for mor us lead to ens the arct becom a saf sec and prosp reg in which to liv and work
