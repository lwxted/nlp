15 quest about miss plane
cnn malays airlin flight 370 disappear saturday somewh ov southeast asia
authorities dont know wher the plan is or what hap to it
here ar answ to som of the most frequ ask quest about thi baffl disappear did the plan go off course
possibly but not certainly
while account from malays auth hav been at tim confus and sometim conflict auth said wednesday that rad pick up an unident aircraft fly ov the malay peninsul into the strait of malacc ear saturday night
that's hundr of mil from the beijing-bound plane's flight path
but auth caut they ar sur the blip was malays airlin flight 370
on tuesday anoth malays off said ther wasnt any evid the plan had turn around
and ear thursday wednesday ev et chin annount on of it satellit had spot a suspect crash are at sea includ three suspect flo object up to 24 met 79 feet long
we could find out mor soon as malays off hav ask intern expert to help interpret the data
what is a transponder
it's a radio transmit in the cockpit that work with ground radar
when it receiv a rad sign it return a cod with the aircraft's posit altitud and cal sign
air traff control us the sign to determin a plane's spee and direction
why did it stop working
that's on of many million-dollar questions
the transpond is situ between the pilot and can be dis with a twist of the wrist but form airlin captain mark weiss said that becaus of the vit inform and thu protect the transpond provid it's high unlik a pilot would turn it off
without the cockpit voic record and flight dat record it's difficult to say who was in the cockpit and exact what hap weiss said
experts also giv conflict opin whil on expert say the circumst point to someon perhap a hijack delib turn the plan around anoth say a catastroph pow fail could explain the anomalies
how doe the search work
authorities break hug swath of ear into much smal grids
then plan or ship sco the grid to elimin them as candid for the crash site
as of wednesday 42 ship and 39 plan from a doz country wer involved
the grid ar mass and mak up 27000 mil of land and sea includ the southern tip of vietnam sou thailand about half of malays and part of the sou chin sea gulf of thailand and strait of malacca
could crowdsourc help find the plane
ostensibly sure
colorado firm digitalglob has on of the most adv commerc satellit network and it im of the strait of malacc and gulf of thailand can capt detail as smal as a basebal field's hom plat the longest sid of which is 17 inches
volunteer can flag anyth they find interest but so many answ the cal thi week that the firm's websit crashed
the websit appear to be up wednesday
also there's the troubl siz of the search area
is thi the first tim a plan has vanished
not at all
sever plan crash hav pos problem search 1988's panam 103 1996's twa 800 and 1999's egyptair 990 among them
but perhap non was as a tricky as air frant 447 which went down aft depart rio de janeiro on jun 1 2009
it took four search and almost two year bef the bulk of the wreck and maj of body wer recovered
the voic and dat record wer found on the oc flo until may 2011
how doe a plan disappear
there's no simpl answ her espec when you consid the bevy of technolog on a state-of-the-art jetlin which includ uhf and vhf radio autom beacon gps and comput commun systems
it doesnt help that flight mh370's flight path is unclear and that the search area includ vast wat and spars pop jungl and mountains
were the pilot experienced
the short answ is yes
fariq ab hamid 27 join malays airlin in 2007 and was first off on the flight
he has 2763 fly hour and was transit to the boe 777-200 aft fin train in a flight simulator
the pilot capt
zaharie ahmad shah 53 has 18365 fly hours
he join the airlin in 1981
there ar report hamid let passeng in the cockpit on anoth flight
is that legal
jonti roo has told sev med outlet that hamid invit her and a friend into the cockpit for most of a 2011 flight from thailand to malaysia
while thi would be a strict viol of us reg put in plac aft the 911 attack the leg would vary from country to country
upon learn of roo claim malays airlin said it was shock whil form us fed avy admin chief of staff michael goldfarb said such behavy by a pilot just viol every cod of conduct
is foul play possible
hijackers
terrorism
th cia and fbi ar rul it out but to be fair auth ar rul out much at thi point
it's high suspicy that the plan may hav turn around
those susp ar furth fuel by the loss of commun with the plan consid the aircraft had redund elect system that would hav to be disabled
robert frant form vic chairm of the us nat transport saf board said his first thought upon hear the circumst of mh370's mystery disappear was that it blew up but ev then an explod would not be hard-and-fast evid of terrorism
what about thos passeng with stol passports
interpol say it has ident the men as ir pour nourmohammad 18 and delav sey mohammad rez 29 and malays investig say neith of them has any app connect to ter organizations
stolen passport certain ar ind of terrorism
in fact interpol say passeng flew without hav their travel docu check against it lost-and-stolen passport databas mor than a bil tim in 2013
among the reason someon might us a stol passport to immigr illeg to anoth country to import good without being tax or to smuggl stol good peopl drug or weapons
what about pilot error
certainly possible
that's what the investig show hap with the 2009 air frant flight though ther was an el of mech fail as well
in that cas though ther was also inc weath not the cas with mh370
as of wednesday noth suggest that pilot er play a rol in the flight's disappearance
so could mech fail explain it
it's on of the stronger possibilities
the abs so far of any debr field could suggest the pilot had to mak an emerg land on wat and it lat sunk benea the sea but ther is stil the mystery of the distress signal
there's wasnt one
however avy consult kit darby has said it's poss ther was a pow problem the backup pow last on an hour and the pilot attempt to turn back to the airport and a reg he knows
there' also the poss of a tail or wing rip off
this particul boe suff a clip wing tip in the past but boe repair it
another fright poss is that a window or door fail which would allow amby temp of 60 degr below zero into the cabin cre a freez fog and giv crew memb on second to don oxyg mask bef they wer dis and then incapacitated
could it hav been hit by a meteor
there was a known met in the are at takeoff but thi seem to be atop a list of strange conspir the pop up in the abs of empir dat explain the plane's disappearance
given what littl is known about the flight path it seem lik a long long shot that a met is to blame
what about report that passeng cel phon continu op aft mh370's disappearance
pleas see ear quest about met and conspir theories
when phon ar dis or turn off which would presum hap aft a plan crash cal to thos cel phon dont ring but go to direct to voic mail
friends and lov on of the miss passeng howev report ring when they called
technology industry analyst jeff kag say a cal would first connect to a network bef try to loc the end us and the ring sound cal hear mask the sil they would otherw hear whil wait for the connect to be made
if it doesnt find the phon aft a few minut aft a few ring then typ it disconnect and that's what's hap he said
