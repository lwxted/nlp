chu 'jeopardy's walt whit 
ewcom who was the last mal monarch who had not prevy been print of wales
dont know the answ off the top of yo head
neither did arth chu who end his 11-game win streak on jeopardy
wednesday night when he incorrect answ the fin quest of the night
chu lost to dian peloquin someon who the controvers jeopardy
star cal a bit devy in a good way
we caught up with him ov the phon to see how he's feel who his favorit movy villain is and who he took som selfy with bef head back hom to ohio
what hap wednesday night
well i lost
i think alex trebek act point it out he saw how i was feel that day
i was real fatigu and i was sort of los my mojo
and dian to her credit pick up on the strategy i was us and she us it herself to gre effect
you said she pick up on yo strategy  was she the first competit to do that
other peopl tri to do it but i think som peopl wer prep to play in a way diff than they'd practiced
diana had the adv that she watch me for a whol day bef hav to play becaus she was an altern the day bef and so she had that tim to prep and she's also a littl bit devious
she' a very clev person i hop she doe wel in her fut games
you hav thi titl as a jeopardy
villain do you rememb the first tim you saw a ment of that in media
there was someon who wrot a tweet i think they wer being tongue-in-cheek they post a pict of my fac and wer lik thi is the fac of a jeopardy
villain can anyon stop him
and that mem sort of ran out of control
ew jeopardy
champ arth chu's win streak end video you've hum embrac that titl of villain
did it get to you at first or was yo init react oh that's funny
it's real mor of an antihero thing
people ar say antihero ar big now peopl say i'm the walt whit of jeopardy or lik i was moneybal jeopardy
it was someth that mad jeopardy
different for a whil and i think a lot of peopl apprecy that
there was thi awesom video by thes taiwanes anim that show me as lit a sup villain with sup powers
i lov that
i said that just thi whol med thing by itself
 you could be any tv or movy villain who would you be
i alway sympath with syndrom in the incred becaus it tot was lik if you dont hav sup pow why not us yo brain to try to fig out a way to giv yourself sup powers
i dont see why that's a bad thing
ken jen might hav just been much nat bet than me at jeopardy but shouldnt we be enco peopl that if you dont necess hav the nat tal to excess at someth without try than success at it by trying
so the fact that the incred show the bad guy syndrom as evil becaus he want to giv everyon the chant to hav sup pow that nev sat wel with me
i see it from the oth perspect if you can us yo brain and fig out inv or trick to compens for yo nat disadv that's what sci is about that's what progress is about
so do you hav any nat talents
laugh there's no way to get money in jeopardy
without know the answ to questions
but it's just lik any oth sport
it's not just about athlet it's about the playbook
everyone who play in the nfl is good enough to play in the nfl for the most part and then it com down to which team was bet coach which team had the bet strategy going into the gam which team us their resourc most effectively
and i dont see a gam show as being any different
who could you tel about yo win streak aft the taping
i end up tel my famy ov christmas becaus i had to explain why i could afford to buy my broth a tv
laughs a lot of my friend said they wer sur that i'd lost on my first episod they said they wer sur the way i was promot it lik tel everybody to com watch it with me lik that must hav been his on gam he must want peopl to support him
laughs ew publ serv annount it's tim to cram for the jeopardy
online test what categ would you ac no question
laughs a categ on let's see text adv comput gam from the 1980s
i would smok that category
that's someth i know way too much about comp to how import it is in lif but that's on of my expert categories
what entertain ar you into what ar you watching
my wif and i real lik orang is the new black we real lik alph hous on amazon and beta also on amazon
actually on of the best thing about beta is thi quot wher there's a charact nam david chu and he say thi awesom thing that i wish i'd thought of it earlier
but thi would be my quot for peopl who dont lik watch me play on jeopardy
 that sound lik a you problem lik a chu problem
so that's my tagline
do you talk to diana
i mess her on monday say ar you ready for what the med is going to do to you on wednseday
because i hadnt anticip the story about me would blow up so big
and she was lik no i hav no ide what to do
i'm freak out
and i was lik youl be fine
laughs what was real cool was that i hap to run into her mom and her best friend in the airport when i was going to fly back to ohio aft the tap and they act they had noth but good thing to say
we took som selfy and everyth and it was cool
so how ar you feeling
obviously i wish i had gon on to be ken jennings
but we cant al be ken jennings
in fact the evid suggest most of us cant be ken jennings
i dont know how he did it
i lik to think i'm the best mer mort in jeopardy
there's dav mad then ther is ken jen who isnt human
it's lik if we wer doing basketbal rank i'd be the best norm basketbal play in hist and then you'd hav michael jord and you know ken jen would be lik god or something
you're lik the the jeopardy
champion of the peopl basically
yeah yeah
i've had peopl say that
they're lik ken jen seem lik he wasnt try it seem lik it was easy for him
whereas for you thi guy was say to me for you it seem lik you struggled a lot
so it was much mor hum it mad me feel lik i could do that
and i was lik that's the mess i want to send to people
