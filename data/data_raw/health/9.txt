cnn i was diagnos with diabet 12 year ago
at the tim i was car for my moth who was on dialys and had had her leg amputated
as a famy we knew very littl about diabet on that ont you got it you detery and died
like our fath who suff a stroke and then died year lat of a mass heart attack brought on by comply of diabetes
both my par in fact died from comply of diabetes
they wer strong pill of our famy and commun tak way too soon by a diseas that is the lead caus of dea among pac islanders
before see the doct i had been expery extrem thirst espec at night
the tip of my toe felt lik bee liv ther and wer desp to burst out of my skin
my vis becam blur aft each meal
it was 2 pm and i hadnt eat anyth when the doct test my blood sug level
it was in the high 200s
normal is between 110 and 125
you hav diabet ms figiel the doct said
he prescrib metformin and direct me to a dietitian
she furth reit what the doct had told me how food was rel to high blood glucos level and how consist high blood glucos level wil ev lead to amput blind kidney fail stroke and oth complications
fit nat why i gav up sod i follow the dietician's plan for the next few months
i took up walk and not that my vis had becom clearer
but it didnt tak me long to fal back to my old eat habits
a colleague's birthday celebr a brother's gradu party a friend's wed a cousin's fun thes wer al occas wher food was at the center

i soon found myself hov around 400 pounds
after six year of or med i was switch to insulin injections
my blood sug level wer too high and i was not man them well
insulin was scary at first
but then i real it gav me the freedom to eat al my favorit foods
i would just inject 100 unit and my blood sug would be norm in a mat of minutes
soon i was inject as much as 300 unit of insulin a day
it was at thi tim that i beg expery extrem pain in my tee and gums
one of my front tee becam long than the rest and i found that i couldnt bit into certain food such as apples
th front too was ev pulled
the dent didnt hav to do much it pretty much fel out on it own
injecting larg amount of insulin meant i was pron to low blood sugar
i would wak up in a swe as energy quick left my body
my 8-year-old son sav my lif continu dur thi tim he knew exact what to do and how to inject insulin
the fact that my lif was being sav by a child sham me
eighteen month ago my sist and i mov our famy from am samo to utah
i saw the mov as an opportun for me not on to chang my own lif but most import to giv my son his childhood
fit nat celebr smal vict the first thing we did as a famy was to enrol at a recr center

the kid had fun in the pool and i found myself walk again
i also decid to educ myself about diabetes
i had read about peopl revers diabet by eat a plant-based diet
it was an easy plan to follow becaus i lov fruit and veget and they ar in abund here

i bought a vitamix blend and start throwing al my veget and fruit into it
by christmas i had drop 80 pounds
then three day bef christmas my dent told me that i had adv periodont diseas and al my tee had to be removed
not effect control my diabet had prov too much for my gums
i was act relieved
i welcom anyth to remov the pain i was experiencing
i decid to ask my friend to film the surgery
