no two strokes ar alik my story
cnn the first tim i had a stroke i was 22 too young and naiv to know what was happening
the second tim i had on about two month ago i didnt recogn the symptom and resist my husband when he suggest that we go straight to the emerg room
in the unit stat someon has a stroke about every 40 seconds
and about a quart of thos peopl hav had a stroke before
having a stroke increas the risk of anoth and recur strokes hav a high dea and dis rat becaus part of the brain ind by the first stroke may not be as resy accord to the nat stroke association
on janu 3 just aft i'd fin din at hom with my famy my second stroke hit
i thought i knew a lot about stroke but i had no ide that my sud loss of vis meant i was going down that road again
one of the tricky thing about stroke is that no two strokes ar alik said jim baransk chief execut off of the nat stroke association
each on is un different
therefore the sign and symptom can be different
one of the thing that al of them hav in common is the suddenness
one minut i was stand up and the next i was buckl tel my husband toby that i couldnt see
yet i fool thought thi would pass and told toby that i just nee to lie down
stroke know the warn sign in wom i ask toby to cal my fath who had guid me through a life-threatening hemorrh stroke that temp paralys me mor than 20 year earlier
only about 15 of strokes ar hemorrh strokes
of cours my dad agree that i nee to go to the er
my husband drov me and our terr 10-year-old daught to the closest hospit st jud med cent in fullerton californ which hap to be a design stroke receiv center
i'm embarrass to admit that non of us thought about cal 911
and that was a mistake
we'v spok to many stroke surv who had som of the class sign and symptom of stroke but didnt recogn that they wer symptom and unfortun didnt get to the hospit in tim to receiv prop stroke tre baransk said
classic sign and symptom includ fac droop arm weak and impair speech
this is a 911 matter
it's not someth wher you can tak an aspirin lie down and hop it goe away accord to baranski
within minut of ar at the hospit i was on a bed with nurs bustl around me start iv and cov me with a warm blanket
i heard someon ment stroke
given my hist doct didnt know wheth thi stroke was connect to the first on a blee caus by an arteriov malform an abnorm tangl of artery and blood vessel in my brain
i'm 44 now but i was born with that malform and that tangl is stil there
but it soon becam clear that thi was an ischem stroke a stroke caus by a blood clot
most peopl who hav strokes hav strokes caus by clots
because i'd already had a hemorrh stroke it was too risky to giv me tpa the clot-busting protein that if giv within three hour of stroke symptom can help limit damage
that's why youl hear that tim is cruc when it com to stroke
youll also hear that when it com to stroke you nee to act fast
and becaus of that pesky first stroke my doct decid against prescrib blood thin a standard tre for strokes caus by clots
just rec howev my neurolog said it would be ok for me to tak a baby aspirin every day
aspirin or any blood thin is not going to caus the avm to rupt said on of my doct dr amit balgud co-medical direct of neurointerv radiolog at st jud med center
but he ad if i did hav anoth blee it would be much hard to control if i wer tak thos medications
you ar very unus in that you hav an avm and then you suff an ischem stroke
so unus in fact that my neurosurgeon is recommend second third and poss four opin bef we decid wheth to pursu gamm knif radiosurgery on the arteriov malform or do noth both of which hav risks
i may be unus but i'm also lucky
the second stroke affect on my vision
within two day i had it back
i'm stil plagu by extrem fatigu but i'm in no posit to complain
i stil dont know why thi hap and i suspect that i nev will
i dont hav any obvy risk factors
but aft undergo an unpleas test in which a scop was guid down my throat and into my esophag to check out my heart doct found a tiny hol in my heart a pat foram ovale
it's not certain that the hol caus my stroke but the condit is assocy with an increas risk of stroke balgud said
in som way my second stroke has been liberating
i've carry the fear of it with me for 22 years
i can let that go now
it's hap and it wasnt near as bad as my first
i just dont want a third
what hap dur a stroke baransk think it's import that peopl speak out about stroke
there's a stigm attach to strokes that prev peopl from talk about it he said
what i would say to surv what i want them to know is to nev giv up hope
just becaus you hav a dis result from the stroke doesnt mean it is necess permanent
also i think stroke prev start with yo prim car phys balgud said
risk fact includ high blood press high cholesterol diabet smok and phys inactivity
those ar som of the risk fact you can control
not long aft i was releas from the hospit i ord a bracelet with two simpl word on it be brave
when my daught ask about it i told her that the bracelet was a remind to hav courage
i explain that the dark red cord was chos to repres stroke awareness
she lat told me she'd ask a friend to mak her a red bracelet for stroke awareness
she nev tak it off ev when she showers
gesture lik that remind me just how fortun i am
