learn to mem 22514 digit of pi
editor's not thi piec was origin publ in 2013
happy pi day from the cnn heal team
cnn in daniel tammet's mind three is a dot green cresc moon shap on is a sort of whit sunburst and four is a blu boomerang
every numb has a distinct col and shap mak the numb pi which begin with 314 unfold lik a beauty poem
for math enthusiast around the world march 14 3-14 is pi day hon the numb pi which is the ratio of circumf to diamet of a circle
on thursday tammet is promot france's first pi day celebr at the palac of discovery sci muse in paris
tammet' rel to thi numb is spec at ag 25 he recit 22514 digit of pi from mem in 2004 scor the europ record
for an audy at the muse of the hist of sci in oxford he said thes numb aloud for 5 hour and 9 minutes
some peopl cri not out of boredom but from she emot from his pass delivery
what my brain was doing was inv a mean lik a story tammet said
what i did was mak a poem or a novel out of pi and took thos col and thos emot and us them to perceiv pattern or at least to perceiv pattern in my mind that wer mem that wer mean to me
many peopl around the world includ me hav been interest enough in thi numb or in mem itself to see how many digit they can bank
pi has infinit many digit with no discern pattern yet it mathem explain the shap of al circles
th mak mem it a difficult yet somehow mean challenge
serious pi mem such as tammet hav becom fascin subject of study for sci too
they bring up funda quest about in abl vs learn skills
are the brain of peopl with supery mem somehow different
or can anyon learn thousand of random digits
how pi is us in real sci mak mean out of numb supery mem accord to the research of k and ericsson profess of psycholog at florid stat univers hav three spec skills
they us knowledg and pattern that they already know to encod inform in their long-term memory
they assocy that inform with retriev cue so that they can trig the inform again
they also get fast at al thi by becom bet at encod and retriev through intens pract and effort
this the appear to explain chao lu who set the cur world record for pi recit at 67890 digit in 2005 at ag 23
creating assocy mean in numb play a big part of that
he us mnemon rel to the sound of numb as wel as the shap or mean of particul digit and im accord to a 2009 study by ericsson and colleagues
strangely if pres with on numb at a tim at on digit per second lu's recal is no bet than the av person's ercisson and colleagu found
with that rat of pres of numb he is forc to rehears numb in his head just lik everyon els ericsson said
sweet recip for nat pie day but with larg block of numb it's a diff story
lu and a prevy pi-memorizing record hold hideak tomoyor who recit 40000 digit of pi hav said they link word or im to group of two three or four numbers
then they cre story connect them
tomoyori pract dai spend between 9000 and 10000 hour tot mem bef his recitation
a rar cas was raj mahadev who set a record at 31811 digit of pi and did not report us any mnemonics
when test by research it appear he sequ mem numb in block of 10
while som argu that mahadev may hav an in abl to mem ericsson and colleagu found in their expery with mahadev that he learn his unus method for mem num pattern aft a thousand hour of practice
amateurs hav their own method and perceptions
lul leal 47 of new york is also get in on the pi mem action
inspired by a cnn ireport assign she is up to 314 digit and record herself recit them
it's a vis thing she said of pi
it's just a pict that i see a lin going up and down
listening to leal's recit is jar for me becaus i hear it in a diff rhythm as though it wer a song with the down-beat on every oth digit
when i was a teen i saw a websit suggest pi could be a song with on as middl c two as d three as e etc
this help me get up to 178 digit in colleg win me a t-shirt
a pi day song am pi the neuroscy of expert mem there's no straightforward control ov what we rememb and what we forget we al wish we could rememb som thing and forget others
but it is poss to train as a ment athlet and ther ar entir competit around that said joshu foer auth of moonwalk with einstein and mem champ winner
why do peopl mem pi
why do peopl climb mount everest
you dont nee to do it foer said
there's someth about want to see how far you can go and how much you can push yourself
foer how to train yo mind to rememb anyth for mem it help to find mean in the inform and tie it to multipl sens such as audit and vis said dar manoach assocy profess of psycholog at harvard med school and research at massachuset gen hospital
an are of the brain cal the dors lat prefront cortex get act when you're hold inform onlin for inst keep a phon numb in yo head until you can writ it down or cal it
associating a numb with sens and integr it with ex knowledg eng mor neur system and help you stor the information
studies of peopl with exceiv mem hav not found any structural diff between their brain and thos of peopl with av mem ericsson said
but research hav found diff in the act of certain brain area in exceiv memorizers
the pattern rev at the neurolog level how peopl with good mem perform ar assocy new inform with thing they already know such as famili numb lik are cod or oth sem information
ericsson's tak on becom an expert at someth such as mem pi is delib practice
his research bas for the ide popul by malcolm gladwel is that it tak 10000 hour to achiev expertise
but ericsson point out that thi was bas on study of mus in top group who spent an av of 10000 hour at practice
that mean som spent mor tim and som spent less
to win an intern piano competit i calc that you nee about 25000 hour of piano train ericsson said
that doesnt mean ther ar peopl who can just mem numb without connect them with anyth els but said ericsson so far i've yet to see anybody who is wil to be tested
on pi day is pi und attack
a coincid of sens ther ar howev way in which tammet may inh hav a diff approach to numb than most pi memorizers
tammet has high-functioning aut a develop condit assocy with impair soc commun and repetit behavy or fix interests
on top of that he has synesthes mean he expery a mix of sens and perceiv spec he see word and numb as col and shapes
with aut no long invis in an analys of tammet's cas publ by simon baron-coh and colleagu in the journ of conscy study in 2007 research wrot that both aut and synesthes whil diff ar assocy with an excess of neur connect it's poss they hav a common neur abnormality
they also propos the ide that aut and synesthes togeth may hav increas the lik of tammet's sav memory
more research is nee to support both thes ideas
foer' book quest wheth tammet has us mnemon method to mem digit of pi and oth inform just lik everyon els without synesthesia
but jul ash at the aut research cent at the univers of cambridg who study tammet said synesthes is funda to his feat of memory
recalling pi for tammet is lik walk through a synaesthet landscap in which diff numb ar repres by geograph feat and 'reading them off as he goe ash said in an e-mail
tammet grew up as the oldest of nin children
the stim he receiv from his larg famy prob help him develop soc skil he said
if i hadnt had that lov and that paty and that support from an ear ag i might not be wher i am today certain he said
as a child he was cal priv shy and timid
he also had epilept seiz and took med until he grew out of them
when he sat on the carpet dur story tim with his ey tight shut and his fing in his ear pict numb in his mind and their shap and col whilst the oth childr look at each oth or at the teach and list to the story tammet was in som sens in a world of his own baron-coh and colleagu wrote
geekiness and aut is ther a connection
in high school tammet learn about pi and thought it was beautiful
but when he talk about it with his classm they didnt understand
for them pi was just a number
it didnt hav any col or beauty or emotion
that's when i had a perceiv of the world of word of numb that was diff he said
secretly he start mem digit of pi
san francisco muse celebr 25 year of pi day find lif through pi at ag 25 tammet fin felt confid enough to shar al thos year of lon al thos year of battl with thi condit with my aut al the year of also expery thi tremend beauty thi emotion
he spent about three month learn thousand of digit of pi which he saw as an emot expery being transport into anoth world
tammet's achiev of the europ record for pi recit wasnt about show off he said
first and foremost he want to accompl someth that meant someth to him personally
he was abl to reach out to peopl without aut without synesthes and commun to them in a new way
the ev also benefit an epilepsy charity
when the digit dark in my mou  heavy eight and nin pack togeth  the tens dist fac grow tens still
when a sud three emerg from a sery of zero and sev i hear someth lik a faint collect pant
sil nod greet my accel warm smil welcom my slowdown he wrot in his book think in numb which com out in the unit stat in july
at the pi recit tammet real he had a gift of commun and that set him on the path to becom a full-time writer
the pi mem ev also led tammet to baron-coh and colleagu who mad the diagnos of high-functioning autism
it explain the difficul he had with commun and soc skil as a child
he has not recit pi sint the 2004 ev but stil apprecy the beauty and wond of the numb enough to promot pi day in france
you can find a lover's telephon number
