(CNN) -- A Pakistani doctor convicted of helping the CIA track Osama bin Laden had his sentence reduced Saturday by 10 years to a total of 23 years.
Last May, Dr. Shakeel Afridi had been convicted of treason and sentenced to 33 years.
He was handed the sentence, together with a $3,500 fine, for spying for the United States.
The time he spent in jail prior to his conviction is not included in the decreased sentence, which is now slated to end on May 23, 2035.
In addition to getting his sentence reduced, his fine was lowered to $1,000.
Munir Azam, the commissioner of the frontier crimes regulation, announced the changes in the northwestern city of Peshawar.
The doctor helped the CIA set up a phony vaccination campaign in an attempt to collect DNA samples from relatives of the al Qaeda leader in order to verify his presence in a compound in Abbottabad.
Bin Laden was killed in the subsequent U.S. raid on the compound in May 2011.
Since then, anti-polio campaigns have been targeted by militants in Pakistan.
At least 22 polio workers have been killed since July 2012.
