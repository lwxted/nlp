robert b lawton sj a jesuit priest and form presid of loyol marymount univers say ther is absolv no ind that jes was good-looking and sexy
in fact ther is a pass in the prophet isaiah that is tak as refer to jesus
it say thi he had no form or majesty that we should look at himnoth in his appear that we should desir him
he was desp and reject by oth a man of suff and acquaint with infirm and as on from whom oth hid their fac he was desp and we held him of no account
isaiah 53
2-3
 whil thi might not be conclud evid it's quit poss that jes was no jew brad pit from palestine
on the oth hand why wouldnt god cre a perfect son
anything that is sexy is going to attract people
peopl who might not go to the movy might want to check it out particul non-christians say the rev

james martin sj editor-at-large for americ magazin and auth of the com book jes a pilgrim agrees
god did not choos to incarn himself in lagun beach he says
he chos to incarn himself at a certain plac at a certain tim in a certain person
and that person was a palestin jew
many peopl hav a hard tim with the hum of jes  the clos he is to hum phys perfect the easy it is for som to acceiv him
but martin say ther is a dang in that too
a phys perfect jes mak him into a god pretend to be man
wh jes was both hum and divine
h was lik us in al thing exceiv sin as the theolog goe martin says
that mean he had a body he got sick he got tir he may hav sprained an ankl or two
there ar pass in the gospel show him fal asleep becaus he was tired
we tend to airbrush the phys imperfect away
those trait mak jes so much mor accessible
so much mor  human
i tri to com up with a liv person to comp to jesus
that of cours is impossible
th closest i can com as a cathol is pop francis
i've grown to rev him
is it becaus he's sexy
in a word no
