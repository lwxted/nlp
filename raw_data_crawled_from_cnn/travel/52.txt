(CNN) -- Whistler, Chamonix, Aspen -- the best known winter sports resorts have become that for a reason.
Not only are the following places worthy of a December-to-February vacation, some are significantly cheaper.
Lech Zürs am Arlberg, Vorarlberg, Austria The small resort of Lech-Zürs is about to get bigger.
As of this winter, itll be connected to nearby Warth-Schröcken by a two-kilometer-long ropeway ski lift, meaning visitors can access 190 kilometers of trails and 47 lifts.
The huge range of accommodations runs from five-star Hotel Almhof Schneider, in the shadow of the Schlegelkopf peak, to the quaint and quirky Pension Astoria, a short walk from the town center.

It's located 32 kilometers from the city of Granada.
This is the sunniest ski region in Europe, although being located at 2,100 meters (6,889 feet) and with a top station at 3,300 meters (10,826) feet, it's known for being a snow-sure resort -- last winter it opened from November until mid-May.
Visitors can rent an apartment, such as those at Apartahotel Trevenque (located next to the resort's main gondola), which has kitchenettes and direct access to the slopes.

Skiers who take the chair lift to the top are rewarded with spectacular views and 360-degree skiing off the peak.
The development of Grey Mountain gives Red Mountain resort a total of 2,682 ski-able acres, putting it in the top 20 North American ski resorts in terms of terrain size.
The Slalom Creek apartments are the resort's newest accommodations, with fireplaces and private Jacuzzi tubs.

With 820 acres spread across eight interconnected mountain peaks, Sunday River is now the second largest ski resort in New England.
The Grand Summit Resort Hotel and Jordan Grand Resort Hotel are the resort's two most popular hotels.
Grand Summit's new restaurant, Camp, will open this winter.

A new chairlift will provide advanced skiers with easy access to the challenging Crow's Face and Strawberry Fields areas, previously reached only by hiking.
The new lift will also connect Sugar Bowl to the largest cross-country ski resort in North America, Royal Gorge.
Sugar Bowl's Lodge is one of the coziest hotels youll find in a ski resort and is accessed via gondola.

Built in 2008 with an extensive network of wide, groomed runs and childcare facilities, it's a destination for families.
It has more than 100 kilometers of ski-able terrain, and its location, in the middle of a forest overlooking the Serre-Ponçon lake, makes it one of the more spectacular places to get a winter snow fix.
There's not a huge range of accommodation in Les Orres, but La Portette has 26 spacious bedrooms, direct access to the piste and stunning mountain views.

Although small, the resort has something for snowboarders and skiers of all abilities: there are five green runs, 34 blue slopes, 26 red runs and six black slopes.
Catalonia is one of the few places in Europe where heli-skiing is legal and there are some fantastic back-country areas.
In 2014, the resort will be holding various events to mark its 50th anniversary.
Accommodation includes luxury offerings such as the five-star Val de Neu hotel (a favorite with the Spanish royal family) or more affordable Melia Royal Tanau, a stylish, slope-side hotel.

Ischgl is already the biggest interconnected ski area in Tyrol, with more than 238 kilometers of runs.
Accommodation in Ischgl includes a number of hotels within meters of the centrally located Silvretta cable car.
Smaller hotels on the outskirts of the resort are equally accessible, thanks to an efficient shuttle bus system.

There are no nightclubs or bars, just lots of snow -- by mid-season there are usually around four meters.
It's a four-hour train ride from Tokyo.
The resort, Japan's oldest, dating to 1911, is surrounded by an astounding 25 ski areas.
Like most Japanese resorts, Myoko Kogen offers traditional and Western accommodation.
Lodge Beetle offers traditional Japanese accommodations high above the main resort -- the owners will personally collect you from the resort on their snowmobiles.

For equally fantastic skiing at half the price, there's nearby Arosa.
At 2,653 meters (8,704 feet) above sea level, it's one of Switzerland's most snow-sure resorts.
This winter a new cable car will connect Arosa with the nearby resort of Lenzerheide.
The hotels here are also some of the prettiest youll find in a ski resort, whether it's the Alpensonne, with views over surrounding mountains, or the Gspan hotel, a quaint wooden cabin that, its website claims, was built in 1621.

It comprises three car-free villages (Riederalp, Bettmeralp, Fiescheralp), all connected by lifts.
There are 11 terrain parks and around 100 kilometers of trails.
In Bettmeralp, Hotel Alpfrieden is a beautiful, stone-clad hotel, loved by return guests for its extensive wine list.
The Art Furrer hotel in Riederalp is centrally located and just a short walk from the ski school.
Switzerland's famous ski train means the resort is equally well connected to Bern, Basel and Zurich.

The World Ski Championships were held here last winter, and as a result, the resort now has several new and incredibly fast lifts.
An hour drive from Salzburg, the town dates to medieval times and is packed with small, family-run cafes, shops and après-ski bars.
One of the most beautiful hotels is the Hotel Schütterhof.
It's well-connected to the slopes and has one of the resort's largest spas.

Unsurprisingly, cross-country skiing is incredibly popular here and although the resort is on the small side, it's ideal for families.
There are 19 runs, two terrain parks and three large ski areas for children.
There are several hotels to choose from, but the beautiful Myrkdalen Cabins offer great access to the slopes and spectacular views over the entire resort, just a 90-minute train journey from Bergen.

The resort's ski area covers three mountains and offers world class skiing.
Experienced skiers and snowboarders should head to the high altitude Alpspitze area, which lies above the tree line.
This is also the location of one of the world's most spectacular viewing platforms, AlpspiX, which juts out from the mountain and from which visitors can peer a thousand meters into the depths below.
