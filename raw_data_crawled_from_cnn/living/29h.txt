Susan Patton, aka "Princeton Mom," is out with a new book, "Marry Smart"
Patton: Women who want to marry should spend 75% of time in college looking for a partner
Women should also never marry a dumb man even if the sex is great, the 59-year-old says
Patton says feminists are trying to "suppress" the conversation around waiting too long to marry
