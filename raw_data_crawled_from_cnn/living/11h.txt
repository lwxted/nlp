Wedding etiquette isn't just for the betrothed -- there's an art to being a good guest
An open bar isn't an excuse for a free-for-all; tip well and don't get sloppy
If you're helping out, don't stress out the couple by being late
So the food may not be top-notch; just smile and say 'Congratulations!'
