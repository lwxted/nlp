Tony Benn who has died in London aged 88, came from a privileged and political family
However he renounced his peerage, and fought for socialist ideas
He was opposed to wars UK government and its U.S. allies were waging
Benn was polite, disciplined, hard working, political: all a campaigner should be - Lindsey German
