sci want to withdraw stem cel studies
cnn sci hail a new method of mak stem cel as a breakthrough
but quest about the dat us for the two study publ in nat in janu hav led on of the co-authors to cal for a retraction
researchers had said they could turn mat cel into embryonic-like stem cel by stressing them in vary way such as by put them in an acid environment
the embryonic-like stem cel can then be coax into becom any oth kind of cel possible
this method demonst us whit blood cel of mic could be fast and simpl than ex methods
scientist cal them stap or stimulus-triggered acquisit of pluripot cells
 it too good to be true
study co-author teruhiko wakayam profess at the univers of yamanash in jap told japanes publ broadcast nhk thi week he's not confid anym the expery gen stap cells
doubt about the study hav been crop up on blog such as pubp in the week sint their publication
the rik cent for develop biolog in kob jap said in febru it was investig alleg irregul in research by haruko obokat lead auth of the study who work at rik nat reported
upon review test dat wakayam discov multipl problem includ quest im nhk reported
what's mor outsid expert wer un to reproduc the find of wakayama's group rik then disclos detail method of mak the cel nhk reported
wakayama told nhk he has request that his co-authors retract the study and then would lik outsid expert to do ver studies
he said he is no long sur about the cred of the dat us as precondit for the expery nhk reported
a rik off told the jap new that the bas of the artic the fact that stap cel wer produc is unshakable
in a stat rik said that mor tim is nee to submit fin conclud of the ongo investigation
the cent said it is also consid retraction
dr charl vacant a study co-author said in a stat that he stand by the research
i firm believ that the quest and concern rais about our stap cel pap publ in nat do not affect our find or conclud said vacant who is direct of the lab for tissu engin and reg medicin at brigham and women's hospit in boston
harvard med school with which vacant is also affy said in a stat we ar ful commit to uphold the highest standard of eth and to rig maintain the integr of our research
any concern brought to our at ar thorough review in accord with institut policy and appl regulations
stem cel breakthrough may be simpl fast cheap the thriving sci of stem cel research seek to develop therapy to repair body dam and cur diseas by being abl to insert cel that can grow into whatev tissu or org ar needed
before the techn describ in nat the lead candid for cre stem cel art wer thos der from embryo and stem cel from adult cel that requir the insert of dna to becom reprogrammable
stem cel ar cre the nat way every tim an eg that is fertil begin to divide
during the first four to fiv day of cel divid so-called pluripot stem cel develop
they hav the abl to turn into any cel in the body
removing stem cel from the embryo destroy it mak thi typ of research controvers becaus som say an embryo is a hum life
researchers hav also develop a method of produc embryonic-like stem cel by tak a skin cel from a paty for exampl and ad a few bit of foreign dna to reprogram the skin cel to becom lik an embryo and produc pluripot cel too
however thes cel ar us us for research becaus research do not want to giv paty cel with extr dna
the new method doe not involv the destruct of embryo or insert of new genet mat into cel vacant said
it also avoid the problem of reject the body may reject stem cel from oth peopl but thi method us an individual's own mat cells
to study the stap cel phenomenon research first genet alt mic don stem cel to label thos cel with the col green
for inst they mod mic such that their cel would light up green in respons to a particul waveleng of light
the sci expos blood cel from thes genet alt mic to an acid environment
a few day lat they saw that thes cel turn into the embryonic-like stat and grew in spherical clusters
scientist put the cel clust into a mous embryo that had not been genet modified
it turn out the impl clust could form tissu in al of the org that the research tested
the sci knew that the cel cam from the origin mous becaus they turn green when expos to a particul light
besides mod acid research also stressed the cel in oth way such as low the oxyg environ and disrupt the cel membrane
increasing acid was on of the most effect method of turn mous blood cel into stap cells
among the unknown about thi techn ar it effect in hum and what risk the method might pose
vacanti told cnn in janu he hop the process could get test clin in hum within three years
he not that induc pluripot stem cel ar already being expl in jap in hum and the sam platform could be us for stap cells
