cnn the pap test the gold standard for detect cerv cant for 60 year may be los it luster
an fda adv commit unanim recommend thi week that a particul hpv test becom the first lin of screening for the dead disease
th test develop by roch detect the dna of the hum papillomavir or hpv which is the caus of mor than 99 of al cerv cancers
the pap test is design to look for abnorm squam cel that could ind cerv cancer
both test ar perform with a vagin swab
up until now the pap was the first test wom had to detect the il with the hpv test as a second analysis
but if the fda follow the adv committee's recommend that would change
th commit which vot unanim to mak the switch would on allow the roch coba test to be us alon as the prim evalu for wom 25 year and older
although ther ar oth hpv test avail the roch test detect two strains of the vir that ar found in 70 of al cerv cancers
every year 12000 wom ar diagnos in the us with cerv cancer
this is espec trag becaus cerv cant is a larg prev diseas and it is wel est that hpv is the caus of almost al cerv cant worldwide
women nee bet access to screening tool that includ prim hpv screening in ord to reduc their risk of develop cerv cant said dr thoma wright jr an expert in gynecolog and patholog at columb univers med center
i am pleas that the fda panel recogn the import of valid sci evid docu the us of prim hpv screening to detect wom at risk of invas cerv cant and allow us to prev cerv cant from developing
this doe not mean the pap test wil go away
it wil real be up to the phys and the paty on how best to handl testing
but accord to women's heal expert in most cas paty who dont hav hpv ar less lik to nee a pap which is why the adv commit felt it best to recommend the roch test be admin as the first form of detection
i think anytim guidelin ar chang it becom confus for both paty and physicians

many phys ar view the recommend with caution
use of the pap test and hpv test in tandem or co-testing is cur the prefer method of cerv cant screening in wom ov 30 so ob-gyns gen us the combination
the us of the hpv test as a first-line screen is prom and appear bet than the pap test us by itself
the real quest is how it comp to co-testing which is not yet clear said dr david chelmow of the depart of obstet and gynecolog at the virgin commonweal univers med center

about half of the cerv cant diagnos in the unit stat ar found in wom who wer nev screened for the disease
at thi tim prim screening is not part of any of the gen us clin pract guidelines
current us guidelin for cerv cant detect recommend that wom between ag 30 and 65 undergo the pap test alon every three year or both the hpv and the pap test every fiv years
although the fda doe not hav to follow the recommend of it adv commit in most cas it doe
