wireless elect it's here
cnn katy hal was shock the second she saw it a light-bulb glow in middl of a room with no wir attached
looking back it was a crud expery she rememb a tiny room fil with gig coop refrig coil the kind you'd see if you crack op the back of yo freezer
she walk in and out between the coil and the bulb and stil the bulb glowed
i said let's work on this
th is the future
what's the trick
we're going to transf pow without any kind of wir say dr hal now chief technolog off at wit a start-up develop wireless reson technology
but we'r not act put elect in the air
what we'r doing is put a magnet field in the air
it work lik thi wit build a sourc reson a coil of elect wir that gen a magnet field when pow is attached
if anoth coil is brought clos an elect charg can be gen in it
no wir required
when you bring a dev into that magnet field it induc a cur in the dev and by that you're abl to transf pow explain dr hall
and lik that the bulb light up
wireless hom dont worry about get zap hal ass that the magnet field us to transf energy ar perfect saf in fact they ar the sam kind of field us in wi-f routers
in the hous of the fut wire-fr energy transf could be as easy as wireless internet
if al goe to witricity's plan smartphon wil charg in yo pocket as you wand around televid wil flick with no wir attach and elect car wil refuel whil sit on the driveway
witric hav already demonst their abl to pow laptop cell-phones and tvs by attach reson coil to battery and an elect car refuel is report in the works
hall see a bright fut for the famy without wir we just dont think about it anym i'm going to driv my car hom and i'm nev going to hav to go to the gas stat and i'm nev going to hav to plug it in
i cant ev imagin how thing wil chang when we liv lik that
world outsid beyond thes effort-saving apply hal see mor revolv steps
when hal first saw the wireless bulb she immedy thought of med technolog see that dev transpl benea the skin could be charg non-intrusively
witricity is now work with a med company to recharg a left-ventricular assist dev a heart-pump essentially
the technolog op the door to any numb of mobl electron dev which hav so far been held back by limit battery lives
the ide of elimin cabl would allow us to re-design thing in way that we hav yet thought of that's just going to mak our dev and everyth that we interact with that much mor efficy mor pract and mayb ev giv brand new functionality
what's next
the challeng now is increas the dist that pow can be transfer efficiently
this dist hal explain is link to the siz of the coil and wit want to perfect the sam long-distance transf to today's small-scale devices
for thi reason the team hav high hop for their new cre aa-sized wireless recharg batteries
for hal the apply ar endless i alway say kid wil say why is it cal wireless
the kid that ar grow up in a coupl of year wil nev hav to plug anyth in again to charg it
