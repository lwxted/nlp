th plain and simpl tru is that sink lost becaus democr vot didnt vote
turnout in the 2012 elect was near doubl what it was in the spec election
democratic off wednesday said by their calc the gop had a plus-13 adv in the vot elect in tuesday's spec elect comp to a plus-five adv for the republ in the district in 2012
