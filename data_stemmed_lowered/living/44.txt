he say he's a risk-taker inspir by his fath a long-time educ and his broth a teach of the year for nearby riversid county in 2013
i've alway been kind of an expl somebody that tri som diff thing bedley said
he's been lucky to hav support admin he said but he's also got result to back him up
as he's tak mor cre approach in the classroom test scor hav ris and his stud lik it too
take mystery skyp it wasnt his ide but as soon as he read about it he knew it could hit sev stat standard his stud nee to learn
there could be glitch and pitfal but if they're going to learn geograph why not try it thi way
just dril them that's not alway the best in my mind as far as teach pedagog bedley said
i want to expos and connect them with kid al ov the unit states
each tim they run the exerc stud ar assign particul job among them a think tank track map fact-checkers confirm what's said note-takers and run mak sur everyon has the inform they nee and on-camera tal ask and answ questions
a stud superv watch the whol process and look for way they can improv next time
a reporter-blogg docu the process
organized chao bedley cal it
he rar appear on camera
the whol thing tak about 20 minut and touch on crit think and problem-solving his stud nee not to ment geograph know-how
students quest hav got bet as they've pract mor and they've act ad new rul to mak it tough no mor googl and guess bas on a city nam they spot in the oth classroom
so far it's working
theyll go hom and research on their own without assign homework or anyth bedley said
his stud just fin their 17th stat minnesota
as a reward for al their hard work they've rec earn a class pet
a hug sometim smel risk any educ wil agree
 it's a tan hamster
bedley's stud nam him hashtag
dont cal him a techy bedley can understand why teach and schools ar wary of the latest-and-greatest technolog they've heard it al before
th technolog that was being provid for schools to us to help kid learn was disastrous
we wer limit to word process or oregon trail  he said of his ear year in education
the tool avail for teach now ar what i wish i would hav had my first year teaching
now he's got byod bring yo own dev classroom wher stud can us cel phon ipod tablet or laptop from hom as long as they've pass a cours on how to us them appropriately
they hav access to a few school comput and bedley has rais money or land grant for big-ticket item such as ipad netbook a webcam and a desktop comput for the classroom
i know my district would want to provid the fund they just dont hav them he said
like a lot of teach he rely on fre tool too
he first tri us skyp in 2009 when budget reduc cut back on art educ for his students
he connect his classroom with work art in oth part of the country so they could stil had a chant to learn
last year his stud skyp with doc from fort meig a war of 1812 battlefield in ohio
when they rev the arm the kid just gasp he said
those kind of mom just driv me to find mor learn opportunities
he' on of near 78000 teach us skyp in the classroom the company reports
sometime ye ther ar glitch techn fail and lesson that dont go as planned
often he can just hop on twit to ask for help and anoth teach wil off up lesson from their own experiences
i tak littl step to integr technolog bedley said
i dont consid myself a techy at all
he see opportun now expl risk-taking it's act easy than it us to be bedley said
as his school shift from it form curricul to the common cor standard there's a lot of room for cre and expery in teach he said
he teach sci writ and hist and hel mak sur the mat is cov but he lik to giv stud opt to show what they've learned
when they study the body's org system stud could tak a tradit test or cre an infograph us piktochart softw or record a lesson for anoth student
they had to shar everyth they knew about say the nerv system
some stud spok for 10 minut and sometim recal fact bedley said ev he couldnt remember
a lot of it align with how they best learn they learn way abov and beyond bedley said
they felt lik they wer experts
he work outsid his classtim too
with his broth he host an onlin talk show ded to educ innov the bedley bro edch show
a coupl of year ago he cre the technolog apply sci fair a souped-up sci fair that ask kid to ident problem and solv them
since it launch it has expand from his school to 10
one stud design a soc network for char in ind to shar extr resources
another coupl of stud gre kid who alway forget their glass cre a program that would autom adjust comput screens so they could read no mat what
it's al on my own
