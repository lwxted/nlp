honestly i was just try to do someth for on littl girl thoma wrot in when we wer fre to be
that it would grow to becom a cult phenomenon was nev a part of the plan
free to be was revolv for it kid-savvy and reach but it wasnt univers beloved
for every fre to be class play anoth school wouldnt acknowledg it

as hap in every mov backslid occur sprung wrot not that plenty of toy wer stil sex viol and color-coded by gender
fortunately classroom mat and children's trad book continu to depict an increas nonsex multirac and includ view of the world
as a kid on long island in the 1970s miriam peskowitz was a frust fre to be fan
she wrot in when we wer fre to be about her femin mom's right let and cal demand her daught be abl tak wood and mech shop or that girl nee not wait for boy to ask them to squ dance

very oft peskowitz wrot al it tak to outsmart gend stereotyp is a littl cre think and a littl gumption
wh we speak about femin to adult we tend to talk about neg and thing gon wrong
 fre to be's cheery stil has the pow to mak our heart sing
it's a kind of femin and a gend vis that is gen and lik and fun al the thing that femin is us accus of lacking

i talk to a lot of teach now who say they couldnt show som of thes thing today lovet said
there's an anxy about discuss someth that might be seen as homosex there's anxy about the school ment someth that would be seen as neg or positive
most educators-in-training ar too young to rememb the heyday of fre to be lovet said and they wouldnt recogn a world wher girl dont hav access to sport and bul is encouraged
