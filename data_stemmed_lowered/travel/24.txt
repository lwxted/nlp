terr vik war 'from hell'
cnn ther ar ghost at the brit museum
hulking hairy bloodthirsty warry grunt in unison as they row the biggest war of it kind the world has ev known
c the gallery cur see them or am i the on one
h laugh a littl nerv ye you do get a sens of them
looming bef us is roskild 6 the largest vik ship ev discov car reconstruct aft 1000 year lanct benea the waves
at 37 met long it's doubl the siz of the boat christopher columb sail to america
ghost army or not it is a sight to behold
the ship's fearsom met fram seem ris from a watery netherworld on a miss to conqu the glob ont and for all
built around 1025 it is the crown jewel in the museum's maj new exhibit expl the vik ag and it sail on an invis wav past glass cas of ant jewel sword and skeletons
it' huge
and you cant stress that enough
even by the standard of writ describ of big vik ship thi is mass say cur thoma william who with his thick beard and car twirl mustach resembl someth of the modern-day norseman
we read about ship of 35 oarsm per sid being extrem big shock big
and thi prob had about 40 oarsm per side
if you saw thi vessel on the horizon with it elab carv anim head prow and singl sail billow in the wind it would hav sign sery troubl was on the way
to see thi com up the riv tham would hav meant domin by a polit elit say williams
it would hav struck ter into people
i suppos in many way it's psycholog warf as much as anyth else
you'r demonst yo pow through the she scal and awesom of thi ship
and of cours we'v got thi on but we dont know how many ther might hav been
dozens hundr of ship  it's fright stuff
danish discovery it's perhap fit that the boat was discov in denmark's roskild fjord by work renov the city's vik muse in 1997
almost a quart of the origin timb remain and it now lin the heart of the recr met structure on display in london
only a person of enorm weal and pow could hav built a boat lik thi with hist point to nor sea rul at the tim cnut the gre a man describ as exceiv tal and strong and the handsomest of men exceiv for his nose
long and sleek the boat not cnut's nos it was design for spee feat low sid so men could leap quick onto land
this is real a troop carry say williams
an amphiby land craft to get lot of men across the sea as fast as possible
barbarians vs braveheart but who wer the vik really
the way the vik ar tradit pres in britain at least is as maraud as thes terr peopl who com from oversea kil al the monk ste yo stuff ste yo wif and off they go again william says
but from a scandinav perspect it's a much mor vary picture
thos peopl who disappear ov the horizon to raid a monastery dont reflect the whol of scandinav socy in that mom that's just what we see from the account of monk writ dur the vik age
that said being seen as a warry was a key part of being a vik man
much lik a hell's angel bik might adorn himself in tattoo to intimid oth a vik might fil down his tee into a hor snarl as on skul on display demonstrated
i think fil down yo tee lik that is a way of say i'm prep to do thi to myself just imagin what i'm prep to do to you  william says
but it's also say i am mark myself out as somebody who is beyond the soc norm
and peopl who ident as being full-time vik wer not the norm
maritime might but of cours the vik wer not simply beefed-up bruisers
they wer supery seaf the first peopl to reach four contin ar in americ long bef christopher columbus
their nav technolog op up new trad rout and help est cities
you cant get away from the fact that there's a gre deal of viol in the vik ag william says
but at the sam tim there's a gre deal of bravery and self-confidence in the desir to expl to op up new horizons
all of thes thing ar quit inspiring
they stil capt our imagin today
