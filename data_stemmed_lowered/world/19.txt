3-d print organs
editor's not dr anthony atal is direct of the wak forest institut for reg medicin in winston-salem nor carolina
he overs a team of mor than 300 phys and research work to develop heal cel therapy and grow replac tissu and org in the lab
cnn 3-d print ar cur being us or expl by a multitud of industry from print toy and automot part to meat and ev houses
in medicin they ar already us to print prosthet limb and mak patient-specific model of body part that surgeon can us as guid dur reconstruct surgery
it's no surpr then that sci around the world ar investig wheth liv cel can be us to print replac org and tissues
3-d print is an excit technolog that i exceiv to play a sign rol as sci expand their abl to engin tissu and org in the lab
what many peopl dont real howev is that the print itself is not the mag ingredy for mak lab-built org a reality
instead print ar a vehic for scal up and autom a process that must begin at the lab bench
before any org can be engin wheth it's print or built by hand ther is much groundwork that must be accomplished
vital to the process is a thorough understand of cel biology
scientists must determin not on what typ of cel to us but how to expand them in the lab and how to keep them al and viabl throughout the engin process
do they nee to be imbed in biocompat material
if so which biom is most suitable
th bar for success is high the structures we engin must funct lik nat tissue
interactiv how 3-d print wil reshap the world lab-built org sci on multipl team hav already demonst that lab-built org can funct quit wel in patients
engineered airway blad blood vessel and urin tub hav been success implanted
what thes structures hav in common is that they ar a combin of cel and biom mad in the shap of an org or tissue
in our init expery engin tissu we mad thes 3-d structures by hand
for exampl by sut a strip of biocompat mat into a tubul shap we mad scaffold for urin tubes
with a pipet cel wer then ad by hand to thes structures
3-d print on the oth hand off the opportun to very prec combin cel and mat into the desir shape
th replac tissu or org can be design on a comput us a patient's med scans
the comput then control the print as it prec print the desir shap and determin cel placement
the print we'v design giv us the opt of us two or mor diff cel typ and plac them exact wher they nee to be someth not poss by hand
read thi reg medicine's prom fut 3-d print also hav the flex of us a vary of biom so that cel can be print in eith gel-like or rigid scaffold or print without scaffolds
in addit structures can be print without cel as was the cas of a print airway splint develop by the univers of michig that sav a young child's life
an ultim goal of bioprint of cours is to be abl to print complex structures such as kidney that can help solv the short of org avail for transplant
while i believ thi is achiev ther ar many challeng to overcom bef thi is a reality
oxygen supply any larg org structure regardless of how it is engin is not lik the ful funct org harvest from a donor
instead ev when print structures ar mad with liv cel they must incub in the body to becom ful functional
as the scaffold grad degrad the cel lay down new tissu result in a new organ
a maj challeng in tissu engin is to supply thes structures with oxyg whil they integr with the body
one poss is to print smal channel into the structures that can be pop with blood vessel cells
another opt might be to print oxygen-producing mat into the scaffolds
while ther ar many challeng to solv i believ the print of complex org wil becom real but not for decades
other project involv bioprint ar furth along and clos to benefit patients
for exampl for the military-funded arm forc institut of reg medicin our team is work to print smal tissu such as bon and musc that would be us in fac reconstruction
we ar also work to print skin cel direct onto burn wounds
but impl tissu is not the on way 3-d print can benefit patients
our team and oth ar us 3-d print to print miny liv that hav the pot to be us for drug testing
in addit in collab with fiv oth institut we ar work to print miny heart lung blood vessel and liv onto chip that wil be connect with a blood substitute
called a body on a chip the system has the pot to spee up the develop of new drug becaus it could pot replac test in anim which can be slow expend and not alway accurate
bioprinting is a rapid develop field of sci that obvy has many pot apply in medicine
even fiv year from now i suspect research wil be pursu pot tre that ar unimagin today
it is import to rememb though that the process involv mor than put cel in a cartridg and press print
developments that occ at the lab bench ar an integr part of the equ and what can be accompl with print depend in larg part on adv in cel biolog and mat science
read the night i inv 3d print read 3-d print tri to find a hom the opin express in thi com ar sol thos of dr anthony atal
